This is the working repository for my PhD project, which was undertaken at the
Centre for Scientific Computing, Cambridge.

Feel free to browse, use, and modify my code, but please attribute my work as
appropriate.

This repo is presented as-is, in the hope that it may be useful to someone in
the future. If you have any quick questions, feel free to drop me an email.
