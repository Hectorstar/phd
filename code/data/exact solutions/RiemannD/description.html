This is a Riemann problem test that corresponds to testcase 2 of Miller 2003. The material obeys the Vinet-Rose equation of state, with material constants chosen to correspond to copper.

The initial conditions are:
<table>
<tr>
<td>
F = <table class="matrix">
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-0.01</td><td>1</td><td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
, u = (2000, 0, 100), s = 118.548
</td>
<td>
if x < 0
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
F = <table class="matrix">
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-0.01</td><td>0</td><td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>, u = (0, -30, -10), s = 48.7088

and the time to which the simulation is run is t=1ms.

<p>
There are three sets of tests run: one set with varying resolution of
100, 200, 400, and 800 cells, and no refinement, and the second
set with a fixed effective resolution of 800 cells, with
coarsest grid level resolutions 100, 200, and 400,
with refinements of factor 2 to achieve the effective resolution.</p>
<p>
The third set of tests varies the slope-limiter used for comparison of their various properties.
We also choose whether to
limit on primitive or conserved variables (for SLIC and MUSCL-Hancock only).
<p>
The first two tests are run with five different flux methods, the first-order
FORCE and Godunov and the second-order SLIC, MUSCL-Hancock and WAF. The third test
is only run for SLIC, MUSCL-Hancock and WAF, being the only methods that use limiters.
