The two main novel developments of this study (the isobaric cookoff technique,
 and the HPR-RGFM) are discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and

\end_inset

 respectively, along with their limitations and potential improvements.
 Before discussing these specifics, it should be noted that there are several
 limitations applicable to this study as a whole.
 Firstly, all tests were carried out in 1D.
 Several multidimensional test cases are presented for the HPR model in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dumbser2015,Boscheri2016"

\end_inset

, including the circular explosion problem, the 3D Taylor-Green vortex,
 and the viscous double Mach reflection problem of Woodward and Colella
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Woodward1984"

\end_inset

, among others.
 However, several aspects of combustion are inherently multidimensional
 phenomena (such as hotspot formation, which can induce inhomogeneities
 in the profiles of combustion waves 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schwendeman2002"

\end_inset

, or gas intrusions and channeling, which are important in deflagration-to-deton
ation processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Asay2010"

\end_inset

).
 The HPR model thus far has not been tested with any consideration of these
 phenomena, and this remains to be done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EOS used in this study was in every case either that of an ideal gas
 or a stiffened gas.
 Thus, solids could not be properly modeled.
 Although in the early days of cookoff simulation, generally only gases
 were considered, the focus now is very much on solids and the fluids that
 they interact with and produce over the course of the process.
 The isotropic hyperelastic EOS from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Titarev2008"

\end_inset

 and the Mie-Gr√ºneisen EOS are used with the HPR model in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Boscheri2016"

\end_inset

, providing some reference results against which to validate a future solid
 cookoff implementation.
 One outstanding problem regarding the HPR model is that of deriving a physicall
y-relevant form of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}\left(\tau_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 that controls the evolution of the distortion tensor for each type of fluid
 or solid that one wishes to simulate.
 The form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

 used in this study works well for Newtonian fluids
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Newtonian fluid is one in which the shear rate is directly proportional
 to the shear stress.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, but is not appropriate for non-Newtonian fluids (where rate of strain
 is not directly proportional to shear stress) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dumbser2015"

\end_inset

.
 As of the time of writing, no other forms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

 have been proposed, and this could form the basis of a future study.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only a very simple one-step, single-phase reaction model was used in this
 study.
 In reality, reaction pathways are extremely complicated, and depending
 on the chemical species being modeled, this level of simplification may
 be highly inadequate.
 For example, Meredith et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Meredith2015"

\end_inset

 recently simulated the ignition of HMX using a condensed-phase model consisting
 of two irreversible decomposition pathways and several subphases with different
 physical properties, and a gas-phase model with 45 species and 231 elementary
 reaction steps.
 In principle, the author sees no reason that the HPR model would not cope
 just as well with these processes as the models used in the cited paper.
 Transitioning between different phases would mean only varying the strain
 dissipation time, and perhaps the EOS; a great simplification to the multi-mode
l frameworks typically used.
 Additionally, the interface dynamics could be treated with the HPR-RGFM,
 rather than the simplified, static interfaces used by Meredith et al.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout this study, the various fluids have been assumed to be immiscible.
 Whilst this is a common assumption in situations where mixing is low or
 practically non-existent, there are many problems which may require it.
 It should be fairly straightforward to implement a mixture model such as
 that proposed by Romenski et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Romenski2007,Romenski2010"

\end_inset

, which uses the same thermal conduction system as the HPR model.
 The results of Gross et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gross2015"

\end_inset

 suggest that the isobaric cookoff technique would still be applicable to
 mixtures of fluids, as pressures still tend to equilibrate, but this is
 a complication that needs to be borne in mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Isobaric Cookoff Technique
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:The-Isobaric-Cookoff-Technique"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Slow Cookoff"

\end_inset

 it was demonstrated that the method proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Slow Cookoff on Bounded Domains"

\end_inset

 can be used to significantly reduce the computational time in the heating
 phase of cookoff simulations on short bounded domains.
 An example of a real-world setup benefiting from this technique would be
 the constant-pressure HMX heating experiments of Renlund et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Renlund1997"

\end_inset

.
 Some examples of numerical experiments benefiting from this technique would
 be the heating phase of the simulations of Kapila, Schwendeman, et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kapila2002,Schwendeman2002"

\end_inset

, where the detonation response to different temperature gradients at constant
 pressure is investigated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The isobaric cookoff technique is, in a sense, similar to existing techniques
 used in modeling solid cookoff, where the material is assumed not to flow
 in the heating phase 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Nichols2014"

\end_inset

.
 The governing system of equations and its method of solution are, however,
 very different, and these previous models do not transform into a flow
 model upon detonation.
 The crucial realisation here is that fluid cookoff can be modeled in the
 same way if the acoustic wave generated by the heating hits bounding wall
 relatively early and pressure equilibrates over a relatively short period
 of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The isobaric cookoff technique is similar to the mass scaling technique
 described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Background"

\end_inset

, in that both produce an approximate, explicitly-solved system with a larger
 time step.
 Both techniques achieve a similar time step increment.
 Whilst the mass scaling technique applies not just to constant-pressure
 flows, the technique here is much more computationally efficient, retains
 the hyperbolic character of the thermal conduction, and does not produce
 spurious oscillations in the motions of the heated materials (as the materials
 are assumed to be motionless while only the reduced system is calculated).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The isobaric cookoff technique only works on bounded domains which are relativel
y short in comparison to the speed of sound in the medium.
 This is because if the initial acoustic wave generated in the heating process
 does not reach the end of the domain early on in the simulation, the constant-p
ressure assumption will not be a realistic approximation to the system,
 leading to an incorrect calculation of the density (derived from the very
 accurate calculation of the temperature by the thermal subsystem).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another problem with the method in its current form is that it assumes that
 the reactive material is structurally homogeneous.
 Whilst this may be a fair assumption in some situations for relatively
 inviscid gases, it is very unlikely to be realistic in many situations
 involving modeling detonations in solids, where gaps and thermal damage
 (porosity and cracks) develop over the long heating phase 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yoh2003"

\end_inset

.
 Inhomogeneities in the reactive materials can lead to very different outcomes,
 as demonstrated by Schwendeman and Kapila 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schwendeman2002"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Potential Improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several improvements that can be made to the isobaric cookoff
 technique.
 Firstly, the current method of switching to the full system when 2.5% of
 the reactant has burnt is primitive.
 Choosing this level did not seem to incur any discrepancies in the results
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Slow Cookoff"

\end_inset

, but at the very least it should be determined whether this level is optimal
 by a parameter study.
 A higher threshold would be desirable, as more of the process could be
 simulated with the quicker reduced system.

\begin_layout Standard
Leveque's

Large Time Step Method

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Leveque1985"

\end_inset

 may present a further technique to speed up the calculation of the heating
 phase.
 This would require solution of the Riemann Problem of the thermal conduction
 subsystem of the HPR model.
 This is a relatively simple, conservative hyperbolic system with sources.
 Whilst there does not appear to be any published exact solutions available,
 there are a variety of techniques that could be applied to solve a Riemann
 Problem such as this (see Montecinos et al.
 for a recent overview 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Montecinos2012"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be that larger speed-ups than those demonstrated here could be achieved
 by the use of an implicit solver for the reduced system, owing to the larger
 time steps that this would permit.
 See Clutter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Clutter2013"

\end_inset

 for some benchmark tests of explicit and implicit solvers for reactive
 systems.
 Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) methods are another technique 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ascher1995,Ascher1997"

\end_inset

, involving solving the acoustic terms implicitly to avoid the acoustic
 CFL condition, while solving the advection and conduction terms explicitly,
 similarly to the method proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mccallen2003"

\end_inset

.
 The explicit solves could be subcycled (repeated many times for each larger
 time step of the implicit solver), permitting the use of the larger implicit
 time steps.
 IMEX methods would allow the simulation of systems displaying non-constant
 pressure, acoustic waves, and flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving the equations at least partly implicitly requires the iterative
 solution of a non-linear system.
 This requires more algorithmic machinery and often tailored preconditioners
 to achieve good convergence speeds.
 The domain of dependence of the solution becomes the whole domain, in some
 sense destroying the localised nature of the hyperbolic system (and the
 associated benefits detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Mathematical Models"

\end_inset

), and making impossible the trivial parallelisation inherent to the original
 system.
 This may prove more costly for very large grids, whereas the cost-per-iteration
 of an explicit solver to the hyperbolic system will not increase substantially,
 as long as additional computational cores are available.
 The performance of a method such as this, compared with that proposed in
 this study, will depend to some extent on both algorithmic, software, and
 hardware implementations, and benchmarking for the desired usage cases
 should be performed to decide which is more desirable.
 It must also be borne in mind that the method proposed in this study is
 much simpler to implement, and the transition period from the reduced to
 the full system does not present any of the myriad issues commonly associated
 with implicit methods, discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Background"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noting the large speed-up produced by the operator-splitting solver applied
 to the reduced system, it may be that the full system could be solved more
 quickly using a similar technique.
 Better-than-first-order accuracy has proved elusive so far with these methods
 applied to the HPR system, however 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "knutsverdrup2016"

\end_inset

.
 This is critical for cookoff simulations, where the detonation waves and
 other phenomena will not be properly resolved with low-order methods.
 In any case, as noted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:Numerical-Methods"

\end_inset

, the ADER-WENO schemes used in this study intuitively seem more expensive
 than necessary, and the development of less expensive methods is desirable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was noted in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Slow Cookoff"

\end_inset

 that the reduced system detonates slightly later than the full system,
 owing to the fact that the convection of warm material away from the heated
 left boundary (a process ignored by the reduced system) results in slightly
 more energy being pumped into the full system, as the boundary is held
 at a fixed temperature.
 To ensure that exactly the same amount of energy has entered both systems
 at each point in time, a fixed flux boundary condition (as described in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Time Step and Boundary Conditions"

\end_inset

) could be used.
 It's important to note, however, that in the rudimentary implementation
 of this condition presented here, at each time step all the additional
 thermal energy resulting from the heat flux is added to just one boundary
 cell.
 If a very find grid is used, this will result in very large, nonphysical
 values for the temperature at the boundary.
 It may be possible to rectify this problem by smearing out the additional
 thermal energy at each time step over a layer a few cells thick at the
 boundary.
 Caution must be taken in deciding which proportions of the total additional
 energy to add to which cells, however, so that a physically-relevant solution
 is obtained.
 It may be instructive to obtain some analytical results regarding the depth
 of penetration of the heat flux over the time step, which would be available
 for the classical Fourier law of heat conduction in some situations.
 Alternatively, a subcycle of the thermal conduction system of the HPR model
 could be perform at the beginning of every time step to determine how far
 the heat flux penetrates the medium, given the temperature and density
 distribution around the boundary.

\begin_layout Standard
The Riemann Ghost Fluid Method presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:An HPR Riemann Ghost Fluid Method"

\end_inset

 has been demonstrated to be a viable way of accurately simulating the interface
s between different materials described by the HPR model.
 Unlike in many existing implementations, heat conduction across the interface
 was simulated accurately.
 This greatly simplifies the conceptual framework required for multiphase
 interactions, as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Background"

\end_inset

.
 Implementation should be easier and quicker, and future work can be more
 focused on a single model, rather than several fundamentally different
 frameworks.

 used to find the star states of the heat flux and the viscous stress tensor
 implicitly assumes that there are only small differences between the side
 states and the star states of the variables upon which 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}^{*},\boldsymbol{\sigma_{1}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 depend (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A_{1}}$
\end_inset

).
 If this is the case, higher order terms of the expansion can be neglected.
 If it is not, however, the method may fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linearised nature of the HPR-RGFM solver also implicitly assumes that
 all waves of interest present in the Riemann Problem are shocks.
 Thus, strong rarefactions may cause the method to fail.
 An example of this is the failure of the HPR-RGFM on the water-gas shock
 tube test (taken from

Potential Improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An obvious improvement to the HPR-RGFM method presented would be to use
 a better Riemann solver than the iterative, linearised solver devised in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:An HPR Riemann Ghost Fluid Method"

\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 be the matrix of left eigenvectors of the primitive system.
 As noted previously, the solver relies upon the fact that each of the following
 relations holds along the characteristic to which it corresponds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L\cdot\frac{d\boldsymbol{P}}{dt}=L\cdot\boldsymbol{S}\label{eq:along-characteristics}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right hand side was set to zero in the approximation process, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}$
\end_inset

 can become arbitrarily stiff, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, although no issues were raised in this study, there may well be times
 at which the source terms cannot be neglected.
 It may be that some numerical method is required to integrate 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:along-characteristics"

\end_inset

 from the left and right interface boundary states to their respective star
 states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, a completely different approximate Riemann solver could be
 employed, such as the universal HLLEM solver of Dumbser et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dumbser2016"

\end_inset

.
 This path-conservative formulation of the HLLEM solver works for general
 non-conservative systems (such as the HPR model) and is simple to implement.
 It's based upon a new path-conservative HLL method (building on the original
 method of Harten, Lax, and van Leer 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Harten1983"

\end_inset

) but is claimed to be able to represent linearly degenerate intermediate
 waves 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with a minimum of smearing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by evaluating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the intermediate characterist
ic fields (given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Eigenstructure of the HPR Model"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are iterative exact Riemann solvers for the equations of non-linear
 elasticity (to which the HPR model reduces as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

).
 Thus, they will work for applications of the HPR model to solids problems
 (and perhaps to very viscous fluids problems too).
 Although these solvers are computationally expensive, they are only used
 once at each material interface point at each time step, and thus the added
 accuracy that they provide may be desirable.
 There are two ways to formulate the equations of non-linear elasticity:
 one in which the deformation tensor (the analogue of the inverse of the
 HPR model's distortion tensor) is evolved in time, and one in which its
 inverse (the analogue of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) is evolved instead.
 Miller's exact solver 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Miller2004"

\end_inset

 uses the first formulation and the solver of Barton et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Barton2009"

\end_inset

 uses the second.
 The former can be used to evolve 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

, from which 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be calculated.
 Unfortunately, both solvers critically assume that the source terms of
 the system vanish, and so are unlikely to produce the correct boundary
 conditions for the HPR-RGFM when modeling relatively inviscid fluids.
 It should also be noted that they cannot be used for problems involving
 heat conduction across material interfaces, and they do not take the thermal
 conduction subsystem of the HPR model into account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a different EOS is used in order to model solids, the derivations of
 the primitive systems matrices of the HPR model (given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:Matrix Forms of the HPR Model"

\end_inset

) will have to be performed again for each EOS, and the form of the eigenvectors
 will change (along with the systems solved to obtain the linearised approximati
ons to the star states for use in the HPR-RGFM).
 Although this is tedious, it is a straightforward derivation to perform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Intermaterial Heat Conduction"

\end_inset

 it was noted that the HPR-RGFM produces aberrations in the heat flux around
 the material interface, when using the temperature fix described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:An HPR Riemann Ghost Fluid Method"

\end_inset

.
 Without using a better Riemann solver, a possible way to remedy this may
 be to specify the desired value of the heat flux in the star state, based
 on physical considerations, rather than obtaining it using the procedure
 detailed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:An HPR Riemann Ghost Fluid Method"

\end_inset

.
 For example, take two different materials in thermal contact, with lengths
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{1}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta x_{2}$
\end_inset

 and temperatures 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$

 at their respective ends.

, then by conservation of energy, the heat flux through the interface is
 given by the following equation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{c}$
\end_inset

 is the thermal conductance coefficient between the two materials:

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{\frac{\Delta x_{1}}{k_{1}}+\frac{\Delta x_{2}}{k_{2}}+\frac{1}{h_{c}}}

Usually,

, and in fact it has been implicitly assumed to vanish in the models presented
 in this study.
 Introducing this fix for the heat flux could make the models more accurate
 in situations where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{h_{c}}$
\end_inset

 diverges significantly from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

Although mass appears to be conserved well in , mass conservation is a well-reco
gnised problem with level set methods , and further investigation is required
 to determine the extent to which the HPR-RGFM may suffer from this, especially
 in multiple dimensions.
 There has been a great deal of work in this area in recent years, and there
 are many potential solutions applicable to the formulation used in this
 study, should there be any issue [REF].
