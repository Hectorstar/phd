This is a Riemann problem test that corresponds to testcase 1 of Barton et al. 2009. The material obeys the isotropic hyperelastic equation of state due to Romenski (Titarev, Romenski, Toro 2008). Material constants are chosen to correspond to copper, given by &rho;<sub>0</sub>=8.93, &alpha;=1, &beta;=3, &gamma;=2, b<sub>0</sub>=2.1, c<sub>0</sub>=4.6.

The initial conditions are:

and the time to which the simulation is run is t=0.06.

<p>
There are three sets of tests run: one set with varying resolution of
100, 200, 400, and 800 cells, and no refinement, and the second
set with a fixed effective resolution of 800 cells, with
coarsest grid level resolutions 100, 200, and 400,
with refinements of factor 2 to achieve the effective resolution.</p>
<p>
The third set of tests varies the slope-limiter used for comparison of their various properties.
We also choose whether to
limit on primitive or conserved variables (for SLIC and MUSCL-Hancock only).
<p>
The first two tests are run with five different flux methods, the first-order
FORCE and Godunov and the second-order SLIC, MUSCL-Hancock and WAF. The third test
is only run for SLIC, MUSCL-Hancock and WAF, being the only methods that use limiters.
