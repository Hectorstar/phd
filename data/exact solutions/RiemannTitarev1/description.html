This is a Riemann problem test that corresponds to testcase 5.1 of Titarev et al. 2006: Impact test problem. The material obeys the isotropic hyperelastic equation of state due to Romenski (Titarev, Romenski, Toro 2008). Material constants are chosen to correspond to copper, given by &rho;<sub>0</sub>=8.93, &alpha;=1, &beta;=3, &gamma;=2, b<sub>0</sub>=2.1, c<sub>0</sub>=4.6.</p>
<p>
The initial conditions are:
<ul>
<li> F = I, u = (5,0,0), S = 0 if x < 0.5 </li>
<li> F = I, u = (-5,0,0), S = 0 if x > 0.5 </li>
</ul>
and the time to which the simulation is run is t=0.03.
</p>
<p>
There are three sets of tests run: one set with varying resolution of
100, 200, 400, and 800 cells, and no refinement, and the second
set with a fixed effective resolution of 800 cells, with
coarsest grid level resolutions 100, 200, and 400,
with refinements of factor 2 to achieve the effective resolution.</p>
<p>
The third set of tests varies the slope-limiter used for comparison of their various properties.
We also choose whether to
limit on primitive or conserved variables (for SLIC and MUSCL-Hancock only).
<p>
The first two tests are run with four different flux methods, the first-order
FORCE and Godunov and the second-order SLIC, MUSCL-Hancock. The third test
is only run for SLIC, MUSCL-Hancock, being the only relevant methods that use limiters.

<p>
NB This test fails when using the linearised Riemann solver (see Titarev et al. 2006) hence we avoid using this solver here. As a result, the WAF approach cannot be used for this test.
