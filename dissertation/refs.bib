	abstract = {A new method is presented for the explicit Eulerian finite difference computation of shock capturing problems involving multiple resolved material phases in three dimensions. We solve separately for each phase the equations of fluid dynamics or solid mechanics, using as interface boundary conditions artificially extended representations of the individual phases. For fluids we use a new 3D spatially unsplit implementation of the piecewise parabolic (PPM) method of Colella and Woodward. For solids we use the 3D spatially unsplit Eulerian solid mechanics method of Miller and Colella. Vacuum and perfectly incompressible obstacles may also be employed as phases. A separate problem is the time evolution of material interfaces, which are represented by planar segments constructed with a volume-of-fluid method. The volume fractions are advanced in time using a second-order 3D spatially unsplit advection routine with a velocity field determined by solution of interface-normal two-phase Riemann problems. From the Riemann problem solutions we also determine cross-interface momentum and energy fluxes. The volume fractions in mixed cells may be arbitrarily small, which would ordinarily make the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy time step stability limit arbitrarily small as well. We overcome this limitation using the mass-redistribution formalism to conservatively redistribute generalized mass in the neighborhood of the split cells. We present an application of this method to an explosion contained in a metal can: a reactive fluid (approximating PBX 9404) is encased within an elastic-plastic solid (approximating copper) surrounded by vacuum. Our implementation is in parallel, and with adaptive mesh refinement.},

The finite volume equations for solids are cast in Lagrangian form with particular attention to the discrete form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We expand upon previous work and propose a new entropy production expression. A new tensor dissipation model is presented that guarantees the viscous stress tensor is symmetric. The new tensor dissipation model shows increased mesh robustness.

It also results in several new schemes with favorable properties. Schemes via the current approach are simple and economical: they solve the conservation laws in differential form and involve only one grid (not two grids that are staggered). In addition, they are conservative. As a result of the new approach, the DG scheme can be formulated using the differential instead of integral form.

Phys., 156 (1999), pp. 43–88] is extended to a more general case with real materials characterized by a Mie–Grüneisen equation of state. As before, the flow regime of interests is assumed to be homogeneous with no jumps in the pressure and velocity (the normal component of it) across the interfaces that separate two regions of different fluid components. The algorithm uses a mixture type of the model system that is formed by combining the Euler equations of gas dynamics for the basic conserved variables and an additional set of effective equations for the problem-dependent material quantities. In this approach, the latter equations are introduced in the algorithm primarily for an easy computation of the pressure from the equation of state, and are derived so as to ensure a consistent modeling of the energy equation near the interfaces where two or more fluid components are present in a grid cell, and also the fulfillment of the mass equation in the other single component regions. A standard high-resolution wave propagation method designed originally for single component flows is generalized to solve the proposed system for multicomponent flows, giving an efficient implementation of the algorithm. Several numerical results are presented in both one and two space dimensions that show the feasibility of the method with the Roe Riemann solver as applied to a reasonable class of practical problems without introducing any spurious oscillations in the pressure near the interfaces. This includes results obtained using a multicomponent version of the AMRCLAW software package of Berger and LeVeque for the simulation of the impact of an underwater aluminum plate to a copper plate in two space dimensions.},

	abstract = {The Mie-Gr¨ uneisen equation of state (EOS) is frequently used in hy- dro simulations to model solids at high pressure (up to a few Mb). It is an incomplete EOS characterized by a Gr¨ uneisen coefficient, Γ = −V (∂eP)V , that is a function of only V . Expressions are de- rived for isentropes and isotherms. This enables the extension to a complete EOS. Thermodynamic consistency requires that the specific heat is a function of a single scaled-temperature. A complete exten- sion is uniquely determined by the temperature dependence of the specific heat at a fixed reference density. In addition we show that if the domain of the EOS extends to T = 0 and the specific heat van- ishes on the zero isotherm then Γ a function of only V is equivalent to a specific heat with a single temperature scale. If the EOS domain does not include the zero isotherm, then a specific heat with a single temperature scale leads to a generalization of the Mie-Gruneisen EOS in which the pressure is linear in both the specific energy and the tem- perature. This corresponds to the limiting case of two temperature scales with one of the scales in the high temperature limit. Such an EOS has previously been used to model liquid nitromethane.},

The JWL EOS is of the Mie-Gr¨ uneisen form with a constant Gr¨ uneisen coefficient and a constants specific heat. It is thermodynamically consistent to specify the temperature at a reference state. However, increasing the refer- ence state temperature restricts the EOS domain in the (V, e)-plane of phase space. The restrictions are due to the conditions that P ≥ 0, T ≥ 0, and the isothermal bulk modulus is positive. Typically, this limits the low temperature regime in expansion. The domain restric- tions can result in the P-T equilibrium EOS of a partly burned HE failing to have a solution in some cases. For application to HE, the heat of detonation is discussed. Example JWL parameters for an HE, both products and reactions, are used to illustrate the restrictions on the domain of the EOS.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an arbitrary high-order accurate ADER Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method on space–time adaptive meshes (AMR) for the solution of two important families of non-linear time dependent partial differential equations for compressible dissipative flows : the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and the equations of viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics in two and three space-dimensions. The work continues a recent series of papers concerning the development and application of a proper a posteriori subcell finite volume limiting procedure suitable for discontinuous Galerkin methods (Dumbser et al., 2014, Zanotti et al., 2015 [40,41]). It is a well known fact that a major weakness of high order DG methods lies in the difficulty of limiting discontinuous solutions, which generate spurious oscillations, namely the so-called ‘Gibbs phenomenon’. In the present work, a nonlinear stabilization of the scheme is sequentially and locally introduced only for troubled cells on the basis of a novel a posteriori detection criterion, i.e. the MOOD approach. The main benefits of the MOOD paradigm, i.e. the computational robustness even in the presence of strong shocks, are preserved and the numerical diffusion is considerably reduced also for the limited cells by resorting to a proper sub-grid. In practice the method first produces a so-called candidate solution by using a high order accurate unlimited DG scheme. Then, a set of numerical and physical detection criteria is applied to the candidate solution, namely: positivity of pressure and density, absence of floating point errors and satisfaction of a discrete maximum principle in the sense of polynomials. Furthermore, in those cells where at least one of these criteria is violated the computed candidate solution is detected as troubled and is locally rejected. Subsequently, a more reliable numerical solution is recomputed a posteriori by employing a more robust but still very accurate ADER-WENO finite volume scheme on the subgrid averages within that troubled cell. Finally, a high order DG polynomial is reconstructed back from the evolved subcell averages. We apply the whole approach for the first time to the equations of compressible gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in the presence of viscosity, thermal conductivity and magnetic resistivity, therefore extending our family of adaptive ADER-DG schemes to cases for which the numerical fluxes also depend on the gradient of the state vector. The distinguished high-resolution properties of the presented numerical scheme standout against a wide number of non-trivial test cases both for the compressible Navier–Stokes and the viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations. The present results show clearly that the shock-capturing capability of the news schemes is significantly enhanced within a cell-by-cell Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) implementation together with time accurate local time stepping (LTS).},

	abstract = {The Riemann problem, and the associated generalized Riemann problem, are increasingly seen as the important building blocks for modern higher order Godunov-type schemes. In the past, building a generalized Riemann problem solver was seen as an intricately mathematical task for complicated physical or engineering problems because the associated Riemann problem is different for each hyperbolic system of interest. This paper changes that situation. The HLLI Riemann solver is a recently-proposed Riemann solver that is universal in that it is applicable to any hyperbolic system, whether in conservation form or with non-conservative products. The HLLI Riemann solver is also complete in the sense that if it is given a complete set of eigenvectors, it represents all waves with minimal dissipation. It is, therefore, very attractive to build a generalized Riemann problem solver version of the HLLI Riemann solver. This is the task that is accomplished in the present paper. We show that at second order, the generalized Riemann problem version of the HLLI Riemann solver is easy to design. Our GRP solver is also complete and universal because it inherits those good properties from original HLLI Riemann solver. We also show how our GRP solver can be adapted to the solution of hyperbolic systems with stiff source terms. Our generalized HLLI Riemann solver is easy to implement and performs robustly and well over a range of test problems. All implementation-related details are presented. Results from several stringent test problems are shown. These test problems are drawn from many different hyperbolic systems, and include hyperbolic systems in conservation form; with non-conservative products; and with stiff source terms. The present generalized Riemann problem solver performs well on all of them.},

The formulation is rotationally invariant and hyperbolic, with a determinable characteristic structure. An operator split approach is proposed for integrating the governing constitutive models for three-dimensional Cauchy problems, in conjunction with a ghost material numerical method to resolve internal Dirichlet boundaries. Such methods naturally allow the generation of new internal boundaries making them ideal for simulating fragmenting materials and macroscale fracture. A remarkable feature of the proposed approach is that the overall complexity compares favourably with that of the model for elastoplastic deformations only.

Such an approach is presented herein, employing a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method within an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations. Applied widely in computational fluid dynamics, these methods are well suited to the involved locally non-smooth finite deformations, circumventing any requirement for artificial viscosity functions for shock capturing. Application of the methods is facilitated through using a model of solid dynamics based upon hyper-elastic theory comprising kinematic evolution equations for the elastic distortion tensor. The model for finite inelastic deformations is phenomenologically equivalent to Maxwell's model of tangential stress relaxation. Closure relations tailored to the expected high-pressure states are proposed and calibrated for the materials of interest. Sharp interface resolution is achieved by employing level-set functions to track boundary motion, along with a ghost material method to capture the necessary internal boundary conditions for material interactions and stress-free surfaces.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new unified family of arbitrary high order accurate explicit one-step finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes for the solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. This new family of numerical methods has first been proposed in [16] for purely hyperbolic systems and has been called PNPMschemes, where N indicates the polynomial degree of the test functions and M is the degree of the polynomials used for flux and source computation. A particular feature of the general PNPMschemes is that they contain classical high order accurate finite volume schemes (N = 0) as well as standard discontinuous Galerkin methods (M = N) just as special cases, which therefore allows for a direct efficiency comparison. In the application section of this paper we first show numerical convergence results on unstructured meshes obtained for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with Sutherland's viscosity law, comparing all third to sixth order accurate PNPMschemes with each other. In order to validate the method also in practice we show several classical steady and unsteady CFD applications, such as the laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate at high Reynolds numbers, flow past a NACA0012 airfoil, the unsteady flows past a circular cylinder and a sphere, the unsteady flows of a compressible mixing layer in two space dimensions and finally we also show applications to supersonic flows with shock Mach numbers up to Ms= 10. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To simulate such problems in the Eulerian framework on a fixed Cartesian mesh, all interfaces (free surfaces as well as interacting material interfaces) are tracked as levelsets; to resolve shocks and interfaces, a quad-tree adaptive mesh is employed. Collisions between embedded objects are resolved using an efficient collision detection algorithm and appropriate ineterfacial conditions are supplied. This paper addresses issues associated with the treatment of all interfaces as sharp entities by defining ghost fields on each side of the interface. Key issues of supplying interfacial conditions at the location of the interface and populating the ghost cells with physically consistent values during and beyond fragmentation events are addressed. An efficient parallel algorithm is used to handle computationally intensive three-dimensional problems. Numerous examples pertaining to impact, penetration, void collapse and fragmentation phenomena are presented along with careful benchmarking to establish the validity, the accuracy and the versatility of the approach.},

In this regard, the ghost fluid method has been successfully used to capture the interface conditions for bothfluid fluid and solid fluid interfaces. However, the ghost fluid method results in over/underheating errors when shocks impact interfaces, and hence must be supplemented with numerical corrective measures to mitigate these errors. Such corrections typically fail for strong shock applications. Variantsand extensions of the ghostfluidmethod have been proposed toremedy its shortcomings with mixed success. In this paper, the performance of approaches based on the ghost fluid method, in the case of strong shocks impinging on immersed solid boundaries in compressible flows, is evaluated. It is found that (from the viewpoint of simplicity, robustness, and accuracy) a reflective boundary condition used in conjunction with a local Riemann solver at the interface proves to be a good choice.

	doi = {10.1007/s10915-010-9400-3},
	abstract = {We propose a simple extension of the well-known Riemann solver of Osher and Solomon (Math. Comput. 38:339–374, 1982) to a certain class of hyperbolic systems in non-conservative form, in particular to shallow-water-type and multi-phase flow models. To this end we apply the formalism of path-conservative schemes introduced by Parés (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 44:300–321, 2006) and Castro et al. (Math. Comput. 75:1103–1134, 2006). For the sake of generality and simplicity, we suggest to compute the inherent path integral numerically using a Gaussian quadrature rule of sufficient accuracy. Published pathconservative schemes to date are based on either the Roe upwind method or on centered approaches. In comparison to these, the proposed new path-conservative Osher-type scheme has several advantages. First, it does not need an entropy fix, in contrast to Roe-type pathconservative schemes. Second, our proposed non-conservative Osher scheme is very simple to implement and nonetheless constitutes a complete Riemann solver in the sense that it attributes a different numerical viscosity to each characteristic field present in the relevant Riemann problem; this is in contrast to centered methods or incomplete Riemann solvers that usually neglect intermediate characteristic fields, hence leading to excessive numerical diffusion. Finally, the interface jump term is differentiable with respect to its arguments, which is useful for steady-state computations in implicit schemes. We also indicate how to extend the method to general unstructured meshes in multiple space dimensions. We show applications of the first order version of the proposed path-conservative Osher-type scheme to the shallow water equations with variable bottom topography and to the two-fluid debris flow model of Pitman \& Le. Then, we apply the higher-order multi-dimensional version of the method to the Baer–Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flow. We also clearly emphasize the limitations of our approach in a special chapter at the end of this article.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe a cell-centered Lagrangian scheme devoted to the numerical simulation of solid dynamics on two-dimensional unstructured grids in planar geometry. This numerical method, utilizes the classical elastic-perfectly plastic material model initially proposed by Wilkins [M.L. Wilkins, Calculation of elastic-plastic flow, Meth. Comput. Phys. (1964)]. In this model, the Cauchy stress tensor is decomposed into the sum of its deviatoric part and the thermodynamic pressure which is defined by means of an equation of state. Regarding the deviatoric stress, its time evolution is governed by a classical constitutive law for isotropic material. The plasticity model employs the von Mises yield criterion and is implemented by means of the radial return algorithm. The numerical scheme relies on a finite volume cell-centered method wherein numerical fluxes are expressed in terms of sub-cell force. The generic form of the sub-cell force is obtained by requiring the scheme to satisfy a semi-discrete dissipation inequality. Sub-cell force and nodal velocity to move the grid are computed consistently with cell volume variation by means of a node-centered solver, which results from total energy conservation. The nominally second-order extension is achieved by developing a two-dimensional extension in the Lagrangian framework of the Generalized Riemann Problem methodology, introduced by Ben-Artzi and Falcovitz [M. Ben-Artzi, J. Falcovitz, Generalized Riemann Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics, Cambridge Monogr. Appl. Comput. Math. (2003)]. Finally, the robustness and the accuracy of the numerical scheme are assessed through the computation of several test cases. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Ignition occurs in the gas phase and the flame propagates back toward the surface of the HMX in what is known as the 'snap-back' effect. The model then transitions to steady-state combustion. Calculations were performed in which the solid HMX is irradiated with heat fluxes ranging from 50 to 1600W/cm2. Results are compared to empirical data for the laser-induced ignition of HMX. Good agreement with these data and other steady-state data (burning rate, surface temperature, melt thickness) provide the necessary validation of the developed model.},

	doi = {10.1088/1364-7830/6/4/302},
	abstract = {Emergence of a detonation in a homogeneous, exothermically reacting medium can be deemed to occur in two phases. The first phase processes the medium so as to create conditions ripe for the onset of detonation. The actual events leading up to preconditioning may vary from one experiment to the next, but typically, at the end of this stage the medium is hot and in a state of nonuni- formity. The second phase consists of the actual formation of the detonation wave via chemico-gasdynamic interactions. This paper considers an idealized medium with simple, rate-sensitive kinetics for which the preconditioned state is modelled as one with an initially prescribed linear gradient of temperature. Accurate and well-resolved numerical computations are carrried out to deter- mine the mode of detonation formation as a function of the size of the initial gradient. For shallow gradients, the result is a decelerating supersonic reaction wave, a weak detonation, whose trajectory is dictated by the initial temperature profile, with only weak intervention from hydrodynamics. If the domain is long enough, or the gradient less shallow, the wave slows down to the Chapman– Jouguet speed and undergoes a swift transition to the ZND structure. For sharp gradients, gasdynamic nonlinearity plays a much stronger role. Now the path to detonation is through an accelerating pulse that runs ahead of the reaction wave and rearranges the induction-time distribution there to one that bears lit- tle resemblance to that corresponding to the initial temperature gradient. The pulse amplifies and steepens, transforming itself into a complex consisting of a lead shock, an induction zone, and a following fast deflagration. As the pulse advances, its three constituent entities attain progressively higher levels of mutual coherence, to emerge as a ZND detonation. For initial gradients that are intermediate in size, aspects of both the extreme scenarios appear in the path to detonation. The novel aspect of this study resides in the fact that it is guided by, and its results are compared with, existing asymptotic analyses of detonation evolution.},

The objective is to design a software environment that will: facilitate computation in a variety of experiments in which strong shock waves impinge on targets comprising various combinations of materials; compute the target materials' subsequent dynamic response; and validate these computations against experimental data. Successfully constructing such a facility requires modeling of the highest accuracy. We must model at atomistic scales to correctly describe the material properties of the target materials and high explosives; at intermediate (meso) scales to understand the micromechanical response of the target materials; and at continuum scales to capture properly the evolution of macroscopic effects. The article outlines such a test facility. Although it is a very simplified version of the facilities found in a shock-compression laboratory, our VTF includes all the basic features, offering a problem solving environment for validating experiments and facilitating further development of simulation capabilities.},

The technique presented is based upon the utilization of a Lagrangian description for both the fluid and the structure. A linear displacement-pressure interpolation pair is used for the fluid whereas the structure utilizes a standard displacement-based formulation. A slight fluid compressibility is assumed that allows to relate the mechanical pressure to the local volume variation. The method described features a global pressure condensation which in turn enables the definition of a purely displacement-based linear system of equations. A matrix-free technique is used for the solution of such linear system, leading to an efficient implementation. The result is a robust method which allows dealing with FSI problems involving arbitrary variations in the shape of the fluid domain. The method is completely free of spurious added-mass effects. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Therefore, it is of great concern of explosive community to predict whether or not a specimen of energetic material will ignite or not under given conditions (defined primarily by a specimen mass and shape, surrounding temperature, etc.). In order to describe the reactive heat conduction phenomena in an infinite slab, cylindrical, and spherical geometry of an explosive material, an own computer program, based on the thermal explosion theory and the finite difference method, was developed. The program was tested by the comparison of calculated times to ignition for some standard high explosives with times to ignition determined experimentally, as well as with times to ignitions calculated by some other authors. The results of calculations were also compared with the results of calculation according to an analytical solution of the heat balance equation derived by Frank-Kamenetskii. It was found out that not only values of the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, but also the kinetic model of thermal decomposition used in the calculation, have a crucial influence on the results of calculation. It was also shown that the Frank-Kamenetskii equation gives considerably lower values of the times to ignition, and higher values of the critical temperatures for explosives studied.},

Another novelty is that the equation of state is given in terms of invariants of the Almansi tensor in a form which separates hydrodynamic and shear effects. This model is compared with another hyperbolic non-conservative model which is widely used in engineering sciences. For this model we develop a Riemann solver and determine some reference solutions which are compared with the conservative model. The numerical results for different tests show good agreement of both models for waves of very small and very large amplitude. However, for waves of intermediate amplitude important discrepancies between results are clearly visible. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A uniqueness theorem is proved subject to condition (E), which is equivalent to Lax's shock inequalities when the system is "genuinely nonlinear." These general observations are then applied to the equations of gas dynamics without the convexity condition Pvv(v, s) {\textgreater} 0. Using condition (E), we prove the uniqueness theorem for the Riemann problem of the gas dynamics equations. This answers a question of Bethe. Next, we establish the relation between the shock speed [sigma] and the entropy S along any shock curve. That the entropy S increases across any shock, first proved by Weyl for the convex case, is established for the nonconvex case by a different method. Wendroff also considered the gas dynamics equations without convexity conditions and constructed a solution to the Riemann problem. Notice that his solution does satisfy our condition (E).},

	abstract = {This paper is devoted to developing a multi-material numerical scheme for non-linear elastic solids, with emphasis on the inclusion of interfacial boundary conditions. In particular for colliding solid objects it is desirable to allow large deformations and relative slide, whilst employing fixed grids and maintaining sharp interfaces. Existing schemes utilising interface tracking methods such as volume-of-fluid typically introduce erroneous transport of tangential momentum across material boundaries. Aside from combatting these difficulties one can also make improvements in a numerical scheme for multiple compressible solids by utilising governing models that facilitate application of high-order shock capturing methods developed for hydrodynamics. A numerical scheme that simultaneously allows for sliding boundaries and utilises such high-order shock capturing methods has not yet been demonstrated. A scheme is proposed here that directly addresses these challenges by extending a ghost cell method for gas-dynamics to solid mechanics, by using a first-order model for elastic materials in conservative form. Interface interactions are captured using the solution of a multi-material Riemann problem which is derived in detail. Several different boundary conditions are considered including solid/solid and solid/vacuum contact problems. Interfaces are tracked using level-set functions. The underlying single material numerical method includes a characteristic based Riemann solver and high-order WENO reconstruction. Numerical solutions of example multi-material problems are provided in comparison to exact solutions for the one-dimensional augmented system, and for a two-dimensional friction experiment. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

(1) where u is the viscosity, a the radius, and V the velocity of the sphere. On the other hand in tile case of the cylinder, moving transversely, no such steady motion is possible. If we suppose the cylinder originally at rest to be started and afterwards maintained in uniform motion, finite effects are propagated to ever greater and greater distances, and the motion of the fluid approaches no limit.

Phys., 227 (2007) 315-352] to the advection-diffusion equation. Specifically, we construct a unified hyperbolic advection-diffusion system by expressing the diffusion term as a first-order hyperbolic system and simply adding the advection term to it. Naturally then, we develop upwind schemes for this entire system; there is thus no need to develop two different schemes, i.e., advection and diffusion schemes. We show that numerical schemes constructed in this way can be automatically uniformly accurate, allow O(h) time step, and compute the solution gradients (viscous stresses/heat fluxes for the Navier-Stokes equations) simultaneously to the same order of accuracy as the main variable, for all Reynolds numbers. We present numerical results for boundary-layer type problems on non-uniform grids in one dimension and irregular triangular grids in two dimensions to demonstrate various remarkable advantages of the proposed approach. In particular, we show that the schemes solving the first-order advection-diffusion system give a tremendous speed-up in CPU time over traditional scalar schemes despite the additional cost of carrying extra variables and solving equations for them. We conclude the paper with discussions on further developments to come. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a Runge-Kutta (RK) central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) gas-kinetic BGK method for the Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed method is based on the CDG method defined on two sets of overlapping meshes to avoid discontinuous solutions at cell interfaces, as well as the gas-kinetic BGK model to evaluate fluxes for both convection and diffusion terms. Redundant representation of the numerical solution in the CDG method offers great convenience in the design of gas-kinetic BGK fluxes. Specifically, the evaluation of fluxes at cell interfaces of one set of computational mesh is right inside the cells of the staggered mesh, hence the corresponding particle distribution function for flux evaluation is much simpler than that in existing gas-kinetic BGK methods. As a central scheme, the proposed CDG-BGK has doubled the memory requirement as the corresponding DG scheme; on the other hand, for the convection part, the CFL time step constraint of the CDG method for numerical stability is relatively large compared with that for the DG method. Numerical boundary conditions have to be treated with special care. Numerical examples for 1D and 2D viscous flow simulations are presented to validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed RK CDG-BGK method. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.compfluid.2016.10.016},
	abstract = {ADER schemes are numerical methods, which can reach an arbitrary order of accuracy in both space and time. They are based on a reconstruction procedure and the solution of generalized Riemann problems. However, for general boundary conditions, in particular of Dirichlet type, a lack of accuracy might occur if a suitable treatment of boundaries conditions is not properly carried out. In this work the treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions for conservation laws in the context of ADER schemes, is concerned. The solution of generalized Riemann problems at the extremes of the computational domain provides the correct influence of boundaries. The reconstruction procedure, for data near to the boundaries, demands information outside the computational domain, which is carried out in terms of ghost cells, which are provided by using the numerical solution of auxiliary problems. These auxiliary problems are hyperbolic and they are constructed from the conservation laws and the information at boundaries, which may be partially or totally known in terms of prescribed functions. The evolution of these problems, unlike the usual manner, is done in space rather than in time due to that these problems are named here, reverse problems. The methodology can be considered as a numerical counterpart of the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for filling ghost cells. However, the use of Taylor series expansions, as well as, Lax-Wendroff procedure, are avoided. For the scalar case is shown that the present procedure preserves the accuracy of the scheme which is reinforced with some numerical results. Expected orders of accuracy for solving conservation laws by using the proposed strategy at boundaries are obtained up to fifth-order in both space and time.},

The fundamental difference from the classical continuum models, such as the Navier-Stokes for example, is that the finite length scale of the continuum particles is not ignored but kept in the model in order to semi-explicitly describe the essence of any flows, that is the process of continuum particles rearrangements. To allow the continuum particle rearrangements, we admit the deformability of particle which is described by the distortion field. The ability of media to flow is characterized by the strain dissipation time which is a characteristic time necessary for a continuum particle to rearrange with one of its neighboring particles. It is shown that the continuum particle length scale is intimately connected with the dissipation time. The governing equations are represented by a system of first order hyperbolic PDEs with source terms modeling the dissipation due to particle rearrangements. Numerical examples justifying the reliability of the proposed approach are demonstrated.},

Examples include confined rate-stick problems and interaction of shock waves with gas cavities or solid particles in explosives. This formulation is based on an augmented Euler approach to account for the mixture of the explosive and its products, and a multi-phase diffuse interface approach to solve for the immiscible interaction between the mixture and the inert materials, so it is in essence a hybrid (augmented Euler and multi-phase) model. As such, it has many of the desirable features of the two approaches and, critically for our applications of interest, it provides the accurate recovery of temperature fields across all components. Moreover, it conveys a lot more physical information than augmented Euler, without the complexity of full multi-phase Baer-Nunziato-type models or the lack of robustness of augmented Euler models in the presence of more than two components. The model can sustain large density differences across material interfaces without the presence of spurious oscillations in velocity and pressure, and it can accommodate realistic equations of state and arbitrary (pressure- or temperature-based) reaction-rate laws. Under certain conditions, we show that the formulation reduces to well-known augmented Euler or multi-phase models, which have been extensively validated and used in practice. The full hybrid model and its reduced forms are validated against problems with exact (or independently-verified numerical) solutions and evaluated for robustness for rate-stick and shock-induced cavity collapse case-studies.},

A massless ideal gas with 2-{\textgreater}2 interactions is considered in a 0+1D Bjorken scenario, appropriate for the early longitudinal expansion stage of the collision. In the scale invariant case of a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s {\textasciitilde} const, we find that Israel-Stewart theory is 10\% accurate in calculating dissipative effects if initially the expansion timescale exceeds half the transport mean free path tau0/lambda0 {\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}2. The same accuracy with Navier-Stokes requires three times larger tau0/lambda0 {\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}6. For dynamics driven by a constant cross section, on the other hand, about 50\% larger tau0/lambda0 {\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}3 (IS) and {\textasciitilde}9 (NS) are needed. For typical applications at RHIC energies s\_\{NN\}**(1/2) {\textasciitilde} 100-200 GeV, these limits imply that even the Israel-Stewart approach becomes marginal when eta/s {\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}0.15. In addition, we find that the 'naive' approximation to Israel-Stewart theory, which neglects products of gradients and dissipative quantities, has an even smaller range of applicability than Navier-Stokes.

The nonlinear system under consideration is purely hyperbolic and contains a source term, the one for the evolution of the electric field, that becomes stiff for low values of the resistivity. For the spatial discretization we propose to use high order PN PM schemes as introduced in Dumbser et al. [M. Dumbser, D. Balsara, E.F. Toro, C.D. Munz, A unified framework for the construction of one-step finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes, Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2008) 8209-8253] for hyperbolic conservation laws and a high order accurate unsplit time-discretization is achieved using the element-local space-time discontinuous Galerkin approach proposed in Dumbser et al. [M. Dumbser, C. Enaux, E.F. Toro, Finite volume schemes of very high order of accuracy for stiff hyperbolic balance laws, Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2008) 3971-4001] for one-dimensional balance laws with stiff source terms. The divergence-free character of the magnetic field is accounted for through the divergence cleaning procedure of Dedner et al. [A. Dedner, F. Kemm, D. Kr??ner, C.-D. Munz, T. Schnitzer, M. Wesenberg, Hyperbolic divergence cleaning for the MHD equations, Journal of Computational Physics 175 (2002) 645-673]. To validate our high order method we first solve some numerical test cases for which exact analytical reference solutions are known and we also show numerical convergence studies in the stiff limit of the RRMHD equations using PN PM schemes from third to fifth order of accuracy in space and time. We also present some applications with shock waves such as a classical shock tube problem with different values for the conductivity as well as a relativistic MHD rotor problem and the relativistic equivalent of the Orszag-Tang vortex problem. We have verified that the proposed method can handle equally well the resistive regime and the stiff limit of ideal relativistic MHD. For these reasons it provides a powerful tool for relativistic astrophysical simulations involving the appearance of magnetic reconnection. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

These issues also pervade all related methods that uncouple the equations by lsquosplittingrsquo the pressure computation from that of the velocity - at least in the presence of solid boundaries and (again) when implicit treatment of the viscous terms is employed. This paper is intended to clarify these issues by showing which intermediate BCs are lsquobestrsquo and why some that are not work well anyway. In particular we show that all intermediate BCs must cause problems related to the regularity of the solution near boundaries, but that a near-miraculous recovery occurs such that accurate results are nevertheless achieved beyond the spurious boundary layer introduced by such methods. The mechanism for this lsquomiraclersquo is related to the existence of a higher-order equation that is actually satisfied by the pressure. All that is required then for projection (splitting, fractional step, etc.) methods to work well is that the spurious boundary layer be thin - as has been largely observed in practice.},

High order spatial accuracy is obtained through a WENO reconstruction, while a high order one-step time discretization is achieved using a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method. Due to the one-step nature of the underlying scheme, the resulting algorithm is particularly well suited for an AMR strategy on space-time adaptive meshes, i.e. with time-accurate local time stepping. The AMR property has been implemented 'cell-by-cell', with a standard tree-type algorithm, while the scheme has been parallelized via the message passing interface (MPI) paradigm. The new scheme has been tested over a wide range of examples for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, including the classical Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). High order in space and time have been confirmed via a numerical convergence study and a detailed analysis of the computational speed-up with respect to highly refined uniform meshes is also presented. We also show test problems where the presented high order AMR scheme behaves clearly better than traditional second order AMR methods. The proposed scheme that combines for the first time high order ADER methods with space-time adaptive grids in two and three space dimensions is likely to become a useful tool in several fields of computational physics, applied mathematics and mechanics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Verification and validation (V\&V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V\&V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V\&V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V\&V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V\&V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors’ contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V\&V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V\&V in production and commercial software.},

	abstract = {An Eulerian, multi-material numerical method is described for computing dynamic problems involving large deformations in elastic-plastic solids. This approach addresses algorithm failures associated with reconnection and change in topology observed in previously proposed formulations. Among the information contained in the deformation gradients commonly employed for defining constitutive laws suitable for solids, only the symmetric matrix tensor obtained from a polar decomposition of the elastic component of the deformation is required to determine the stress state. The numerical utilization of this symmetric tensor, associated with material stretch, eliminates undesirable, discontinuous deformation states produced by local rigid-body rotations at same-material reconnecting interfaces. Such states appear even where stress states in impacting regions are similar. The temporal evolution of the stretches neither modifies the eigenstructure of the system of equations nor changes its size. We also present a new multi-material approximate Riemann solver based on the HLLD approach, previously applied to other hyperbolic systems, in which waves of distinct velocity exist, for example, as in magnetohydrodynamics. This solver is employed in combination with the modified ghost fluid method (M-GFM) in the description of multi-material interfaces. These composite algorithms enable numerical simulations of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (i.e., the instability produced by the interaction of an interface separating materials of different density with a shock wave at an angle) in converging geometries for solid materials that would have previously led to the failure of the method. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Since standard "black box" packages may be too inefficient if the number of matrices is large, we study several alternatives. We consider optimized implementations of the Jacobi, QL, and Cuppen algorithms and compare them with an analytical method relying on Cardano's formula for the eigenvalues and on vector cross products for the eigenvectors. Jacobi is the most accurate, but also the slowest method, while QL and Cuppen are good general purpose algorithms. The analytical algorithm outperforms the others by more than a factor of 2, but becomes inaccurate or may even fail completely if the matrix entries differ greatly in magnitude. This can mostly be circumvented by using a hybrid method, which falls back to QL if conditions are such that the analytical calculation might become too inaccurate.

	abstract = {A numerical method for the computation of the Singular Value De- composition of 3×3 matrices is presented. The proposed method- ology robustly handles rank-deficient matrices and guarantees or- thonormality of the computed rotational factors. The algorithm is tailored to the characteristics of SIMD or vector processors. In par- ticular, it does not require any explicit branching beyond simple conditional assignments (as in the C++ ternary operator ?:, or the SSE4.1 instruction VBLENDPS), enabling trivial data-level paral- lelism for any number of operations. Furthermore, no trigonometric or other expensive operations are required; the only floating point operations utilized are addition, multiplication, and an inexact (yet fast) reciprocal square root which is broadly available on current SIMD/vector architectures. The performance observed approaches the limit of making the 3×3 SVD a memory-bound (as opposed to CPU-bound) operation on current SMP platforms.},

	abstract = {We present a new version of conservative ADER-WENO finite volume schemes, in which both the high order spatial reconstruction as well as the time evolution of the reconstruction polynomials in the local space-time predictor stage are performed in primitive variables, rather than in conserved ones. To obtain a conservative method, the underlying finite volume scheme is still written in terms of the cell averages of the conserved quantities. Therefore, our new approach performs the spatial WENO reconstruction twice:the first WENO reconstruction is carried out on the known cell averages of the conservative variables. TheWENO polynomials are then used at the cell centers to compute point values of the conserved variables, which are subsequently converted into point values of the primitive variables. This is the only place where the conversion from conservative to primitive variables is needed in the new scheme. Then, a second WENO reconstruction is performed on the point values of the primitive variables to obtain piecewise high order reconstruction polynomials of the primitive variables. The reconstruction polynomials are subsequently evolved in time with a novel space-time finite element predictor that is directly applied to the governing PDE written in primitive form. The resulting space-time polynomials of the primitive variables can then be directly used as input for the numerical fluxes at the cell boundaries in the underlying conservative finite volume scheme. Hence, the number of necessary conversions fromthe conserved to the primitive variables is reduced to just one single conversion at each cell center.We have verified the validity of the new approach over a wide range of hyperbolic systems, including the classical Euler equations of gas dynamics, the special relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) and ideal magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) equations, as well as the Baer-Nunziato model for compressible two-phase flows. In all cases we have noticed that the new ADER schemes provide less oscillatory solutions when compared to ADER finite volume schemes based on the reconstruction in conserved variables, especially for the RMHD and the Baer-Nunziato equations. For the RHD and RMHD equations, the overall accuracy is improved and the CPU time is reduced by about 25\%. Because of its increased accuracy and due to the reduced computational cost, we recommend to use this version of ADER as the standard one in the relativistic framework. At the end of the paper, the new approach has also been extended to ADER-DG schemes on space-time adaptive grids (AMR).},

As a result of the substitution of the concept of the viscosity coefficient by a microphysics-based temporal characteristic, particle settled life (PSL) time, it becomes possible to formulate a model for viscous fluids in a form of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations. Moreover, the concept of PSL time allows the use of the same model for flows of viscous fluids (Newtonian or non-Newtonian) as well as irreversible deformation of solids. In the theory presented, a continuum is interpreted as a system of material particles connected by bonds; the internal resistance to flow is interpreted as elastic stretching of the particle bonds; and a flow is a result of bond destructions and rearrangements of particles. Finally, we examine the model for simple shear flows, arbitrary incompressible and compressible flows of Newtonian fluids and demonstrate that Newton’s viscous law can be obtained in the framework of the developed hyperbolic theory as a steady-state limit. A basic relation between the viscosity coefficient, PSL time, and the shear sound velocity is also obtained.},

	abstract = {The present paper introduces a class of finite volume schemes of increasing order of accuracy in space and time for hyperbolic systems that are in conservation form. The methods are specially suited for efficient implementation on structured meshes. The hyperbolic system is required to be non-stiff. This paper specifically focuses on Euler system that is used for modeling the flow of neutral fluids and the divergence-free, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system that is used for large scale modeling of ionized plasmas. Efficient techniques for weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) interpolation have been developed for finite volume reconstruction on structured meshes. We have shown that the most elegant and compact formulation of WENO reconstruction obtains when the interpolating functions are expressed in modal space. Explicit formulae have been provided for schemes having up to fourth order of spatial accuracy. Divergence-free evolution of magnetic fields requires the magnetic field components and their moments to be defined in the zone faces. We draw on a reconstruction strategy developed recently by the first author to show that a high order specification of the magnetic field components in zone-faces naturally furnishes an appropriately high order representation of the magnetic field within the zone. We also present a new formulation of the ADER (for Arbitrary Derivative Riemann Problem) schemes that relies on a local continuous space-time Galerkin formulation instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure. We call such schemes ADER-CG and show that a very elegant and compact formulation results when the scheme is formulated in modal space. Explicit formulae have been provided on structured meshes for ADER-CG schemes in three dimensions for all orders of accuracy that extend up to fourth order. Such ADER schemes have been used to temporally evolve the WENO-based spatial reconstruction. The resulting ADER-WENO schemes provide temporal accuracy that matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying WENO reconstruction. In this paper we have also provided a point-wise description of ADER-WENO schemes for divergence-free MHD in a fashion that facilitates computer implementation. The schemes reported here have all been implemented in the RIEMANN framework for computational astrophysics. All the methods presented have a one-step update, making them low-storage alternatives to the usual Runge-Kutta time-discretization. Their one-step update also makes them suitable building blocks for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) calculations. We demonstrate that the ADER-WENO meet their design accuracies. Several stringent test problems of Euler flows and MHD flows are presented in one, two and three dimensions. Many of our test problems involve near infinite shocks in multiple dimensions and the higher order schemes are shown to perform very robustly and accurately under all conditions. It is shown that the increasing computational complexity with increasing order is handily offset by the increased accuracy of the scheme. The resulting ADER-WENO schemes are, therefore, very worthy alternatives to the standard second order schemes for compressible Euler and MHD flow. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We provide numerical evidence that when starting with this initial guess, the final iterative scheme for the solution of the nonlinear algebraic equations of the local space-time DG predictor method becomes more efficient.

	abstract = {A number of contributions have been made during the last decades to model pure-diffusive transport problems by using the so-called hyperbolic diffusion equations [M. Zakari, D. Jou, Equations of state and transport equations in viscous cosmological models, Phys. Rev. D 48 (1993) 1597-1601; T. Ruggeri, A. Muracchini, L. Seccia, Shock waves and second sound in a rigid heat conductor: a critical temperature for NaF and Bi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64 (1990) 2640-2643]. These equations are used for both mass and heat transport. The hyperbolic diffusion equations are obtained by substituting the classic time-independent constitutive equation (Fick's [A. Fick, Uber diffusion, Poggendorff's Annal. Phys. Chem. 94 (1855) 59-86] and Fourier's [J.B. Fourier, Th??orie analytique de la chaleur, Jacques Gabay, 1822] law, respectively) by a more general time-dependent equation, due to Cattaneo [M.C. Cattaneo, Sur une forme de l'equation de la chaleur liminant le paradoxe d'une propagation instantane, Comptes Rendus de L'Academie des Sciences: Series I-Mathematics 247 (1958) 431-433]. In some applications the use of a parabolic model for diffusive processes is accurate enough in spite of predicting an infinite speed of propagation (Cattaneo, 1958). However, the use of a wave-like equation that predicts a finite velocity of propagation is necessary in many other calculations [A. Compte, The generalized Cattaneo equation for the description of anomalous transport processes, J. Phys. A: Math. General 30 (1997) 7277-7289]. The studies of heat or mass transport with finite velocity of propagation have been limited, so far, to pure-diffusive situations. This paper proposes a formulation for convection-diffusion problems based on a Cattaneo-type law. The finite element solution of the proposed equations is addressed. The performance of the algorithm is verified by solving some 2D test cases. Some interesting features of the proposed model can be observed from these examples and we conclude that the proposal is a feasible alternative to the parabolic model for real engineering simulations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A chemically-active flow governed by the reactive Euler equations, which has an exact solution, is used as a validation exercise. Various (previously loosely-connected) pieces of numerical and analytical work are brought together in lieu of a review, to set the scene for the multidimensional studies that follow. Two-dimensional flow is induced by a temperature perturbation ΔT of order ε (the dimensionless inverse activation energy), in an otherwise planar flowfield. The effect of small variations in AT on the ignition pattern is investigated by means of a series of numerical integrations.

	abstract = {This paper reviews some of the recent developments in upstream difference schemes through a unified representation, in order to enable comparison between the various schemes. Special attention is given to the Godunov-type schemes that result from using an approximate solution of the Riemann problem. For schemes based on flux splitting, the approximate Riemann solution can be interpreted as a solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. Introduction. Upstream-differencing schemes attempt to discretize hyperbolic par-tial differential equations by using differences biased in the direction determined by the sign of the characteristic speed. In recent years upstream differencing has become very popular, and a multitude of new techniques of implementing directionally biased differencing have been suggested. This popularity is primarily due to the robustness of upstream-differencing schemes, the availability of an underlying physical model, and the possibility of achieving high resolution of stationary discontinuities. Most of these schemes are an extension of the Courant-Isaacson-Rees scheme [1] to nonlinear conservation laws, and therefore a unified description may be given. The present paper concentrates on reviewing basic concepts and deriving design principles; numerical experimentation is not presented. The paper is built up as follows. Section 1 reviews some properties of the equations essential to their proper numerical approximation. In ?2 we discuss a straightforward extension of linear upstream differenc-ing to nonlinear systems. Section 3 introduces the physical picture due to Godunov, useful to interpret certain schemes from ?2 and to construct new schemes. Finally, in ?4 we comment on flux splitting, another form of upstream differencing, and relate it to a class of schemes motivated by the Boltzmann equation. 1.

	abstract = {The process of planar detonation ignition, induced by a constant-velocity piston or equivalently by a shock reflected from a stationary wall, is investigated using high-resolution one-dimensional numerical simulations. The standard one-step model with Arrhenius kinetics, which models thermally sensitive explosives, is employed. Emphasis is on comparing and contrasting the results of the finite activation temperature simulations with high activation temperature asymptotic predictions and previous simulations. During the induction phase, it is shown that the asymptotic results give qualitatively good predictions. However, for parameters representative of gaseous explosives, subsequent to thermal runaway at the piston and the formation of a reaction wave, the high activation temperature asymptotic theory is qualitatively incorrect for moderately high activation temperatures. It is shown that the results are very sensitive to the value of the activation temperature, especially the distance from the piston at which a secondary shock forms and the degree of unsteadiness in the reaction wave which moves away from the piston. The dependence of the ignition evolution on the other parameters (initial shock Mach number, heat of reaction and polytropic index) is also investigated. It is shown that qualitative predictions regarding the dependence of the ignition evolution on each of the parameters can be elucidated from finite activation temperature homogeneous explosion calculations together with the high activation temperature asymptotic shock ignition results. It is found that for sufficiently strong initiating shocks the ignition evolution is qualitatively different from cases studied previously in that no secondary shock forms. For a high polytropic index, corresponding to a simple equation of state model for condensed phase explosives, the results are in much better qualitative agreement with the asymptotic theory.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jcp.2007.12.005},
	abstract = {In this article, we propose a new class of finite volume schemes of arbitrary accuracy in space and time for systems of hyperbolic balance laws with stiff source terms. The new class of schemes is based on a three stage procedure. First a high-order WENO reconstruction procedure is applied to the cell averages at the current time level. Second, the temporal evolution of the reconstruction polynomials is computed locally inside each cell using the governing equations. In the original ENO scheme of Harten et al. and in the ADER schemes of Titarev and Toro, this time evolution is achieved via a Taylor series expansion where the time derivatives are computed by repeated differentiation of the governing PDE with respect to space and time, i.e. by applying the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure. However, this approach is not able to handle stiff source terms. Therefore, we present a new strategy that only replaces the Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure compared to the previously mentioned schemes. For the time-evolution part of the algorithm, we introduce a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element scheme that is able to handle also stiff source terms. This step is the only part of the algorithm which is locally implicit. The third and last step of the proposed ADER finite volume schemes consists of the standard explicit space-time integration over each control volume, using the local space-time DG solutions at the Gaussian integration points for the intercell fluxes and for the space-time integral over the source term. We will show numerical convergence studies for nonlinear systems in one space dimension with both non-stiff and with very stiff source terms up to sixth order of accuracy in space and time. The application of the new method to a large set of different test cases is shown, in particular the stiff scalar model problem of LeVeque and Yee [R.J. LeVeque, H.C.

Also material interfaces are present between the explosive and the surrounding inert or reactive materials. We develop a new method for the modelling of interface problems and multiphase mixtures in the particular limit where phases pressures and velocities relax towards equilibrium very fast. This method is a variant of the discrete equations for multiphase mixtures proposed by Abgrall and Saurel [J. Comput. Phys. 186 (2) (2003) 361]. The new discrete model is adapted to reacting flows with mass, momentum and energy transfer. The model is based on the pure material equation of state only (no mixture equation of state is used) for the computation of the reaction zone of detonation waves. The algorithm is full Eulerian and fulfills interface conditions between mixtures and pure materials automatically. It is validated over a set of difficult test problems with exact solution and its multi-dimensional capabilities are shown over problems involving a large number of materials. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We believe that the most robust schemes will combine the best properties of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for treating interfaces in Eulerian schemes that maintains a Heaviside profile of the density with no numerical smearing along the lines of earlier work and most Lagrangian schemes. We use a level set function to track the motion of a multimaterial interface in an Eulerian framework. In addition, the use of ghost cells (actually ghost nodes in our finite difference framework) and a new isobaric fix technique allows us to keep the density profile from smearing out, while still keeping the scheme robust and easy to program with simple extensions to multidimensions and multilevel time integration, e.g., Runge–Kutta methods. In contrast, previous methods used ill-advised dimensional splitting for multidimensional problems and suffered from great complexity when used in conjunction with multilevel time integrators.},

	abstract = {The similarity solution to the Riemann problem of the one dimensional shallow water equations (SWE) with a bottom step discontinuity is presented. The step is placed at the same location where the flow variables are initially discontinuous. While the solutions found are still a superposition of travelling waves belonging to the two well-known families of the shallow water system, namely hydraulic jumps and rarefactions, the appearance of a standing discontinuity at the step position produces a very interesting solution pattern. This is mainly due to the asymmetry introduced by the step. The adopted solution procedure combines the basic theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws together with a sound interpretation of the physical concepts embedded in the shallow water system. This finally leads to a set of algebraic equations that must be iteratively solved. The ideas contained in this paper may be of valuable help to the understanding of the behaviour of the SWE with source terms, that constitute the core of many mathematical models for free surface flow simulation.},

Recent improvements to the code have aided the computational capability in modeling the behavior of energetic materials systems exposed to strong thermal environments such as fires. These models and computational techniques are applied to a thermal explosion expt. involving the slow heating of a confined explosive. The model includes the transition from slow heating to rapid deflagration in which the time scale decreases from days to hundreds of microseconds. Thermal, mech., and chem. effects are modeled during all phases of this process. The heating stage involves thermal expansion and decompn. according to an Arrhenius kinetics model while a pressure-dependent burn model is employed during the explosive phase. The numerical strategies employed to make the transition from slow to fast dynamics are described and demonstrated. In addn., the sensitivity is investigated of wall expansion rates to numerical strategies and parameters. Results from a one-dimensional model show that violence is affected by the presence of a gap between the explosive and container.

A WENO reconstruction technique is used to achieve high order of accuracy in space, while an element-local space-time Discontinuous Galerkin finite element predictor on moving curved meshes is used to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization. Within the space-time predictor the physical element is mapped onto a reference element using a high order isoparametric approach, where the space-time basis and test functions are given by the Lagrange interpolation polynomials passing through a predefined set of space-time nodes. Since our algorithm is cell-centered, the final mesh motion is computed by using a suitable node solver algorithm. A rezoning step as well as a flattener strategy are used in some of the test problems to avoid mesh tangling or excessive element deformations that may occur when the computation involves strong shocks or shear waves. The ALE algorithm presented in this article belongs to the so-called direct ALE methods because the final Lagrangian finite volume scheme is based directly on a space-time conservation formulation of the governing PDE system, with the rezoned geometry taken already into account during the computation of the fluxes.We apply our new high order unstructured ALE schemes to the 3D Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics, for which a set of classical numerical test problems has been solved and for which convergence rates up to sixth order of accuracy in space and time have been obtained.

It has been found that such GFMs encounter many difficulties when applied to shock impedance matching (-like) problems due to the inability of accurately imposing interfacial conditions. By predicting the flow states for the real fluid nodes just next to the interface and the ghost fluid nodes using the Riemann problem solver, a more accurate interface boundary condition can be imposed and the said difficulties are mitigated to a large extent.

	abstract = {A thermodynamically consistent and fully conservative (TCFC) treatment of contact discontinuities (designated as TCFC model in this paper) is proposed for the simulation of compressible multicomponent flows with shock-interface interactions, yielding an accurate capture of contact discontinuities. Starting from the total energy equation of the mixture, a new formulation is developed to define the ratio of specific heats of the mixture, and a governing equation in conservative form for the pressure is subsequently obtained. Another formulation is derived to determine the molecular weight of the mixture from classical thermodynamics. The governing equations in conservative form are further derived to calculate the specific heats ratio and the molecular weight of the mixture with their new formulations and the continuity or mass fraction equations for the individual components. Finally, the governing equations for the ratio of specific heats, the molecular weight and the pressure, combined with the continuity and momentum equations, offer the new hyperbolic conservation laws for the description of multicomponent or multifluid flows with shock-interface interactions. A simple version of the model is also developed without solving the governing equation for the molecular weight of the mixture. A brief analysis of the numerical uncertainties of conventional conservation models and the present TCFC models is presented and the consistency of any additional equation derived within any model with the initial governing equations is investigated. An analysis of the proposed TCFC model and the conventional conservative models is also performed on the pressure evolution for a mixture associated with isolated contact discontinuities. The results show that the present TCFC model produces a uniform pressure field and thus the pressure maintains in equilibrium across the material interfaces. The proposed TCFC model is then implemented into a Godunov-type method based upon a fast, exact Riemann solver. Several multicomponent flow problems with both strong and weak shocks are simulated using this new model and conventional conservation models, and comparisons of the numerical results from the various models and, where possible, exact solutions are performed. It is shown that the proposed TCFC model can handle both strong and weak shocks, and that the numerical solutions are completely oscillation-free through the contact discontinuities. This new approach offers a suitable treatment of contact discontinuities for compressible multicomponent flows and also maintains all the favorable features of fully conservative conservation laws. It belongs to the conservative approaches and is independent of numerical schemes. From the analysis of the numerical uncertainties of several models proposed in the past and the present numerical experiments, it is determined that the conservative or non-conservative form of some additional governing equations is not the ultimate reason that produces oscillating solutions near the material interfaces. The main cause of the oscillating solutions with conventional conservation models is the inappropriate determination of the ratio of specific heats of the mixture. Oscillation-free results are obtained for two test cases with weak shocks even with conventional conservation models using the present Godunov-type method based on a fast exact Riemann solver. This suggests that the problems with weak shocks and strong post-shock contact discontinuities are not suitable for the model validation in multicomponent flows. The capability of handling strong shocks and weak post-shock contact discontinuities is more critical to the demonstration of any model for compressible multicomponent or multifluid flows. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Our path-conservative centered scheme is an extension of the centered method recently proposed in [40] for conservation laws, to which it reduces if the system matrix is the Jacobian of a flux function. The main advantage in the proposed centered approach compared to upwind methods is that no information about the eigenstructure of the system or Roe averages are needed. The final fully discrete high order accurate formulation in space and time is obtained using the general framework of PN PM schemes proposed in [16], which unifies in one single general family of schemes classical finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods. These PN PM methods can also be called reconstructed discontinuous Galerkin schemes, due to the use of the PN PM least-squares reconstruction operator.

	abstract = {This text presents the standard material usually covered in a one-semester, undergraduate course on boundary value problems and PDEs. Emphasis is placed on motivation, concepts, methods, and interpretation, rather than on formal theory. The concise treatment of the subject is maintained in this third edition covering all the major ideas: the wave equation, the diffusion equation, the Laplace equation, and the advection equation on bounded and unbounded domains. Methods include eigenfunction expansions, integral transforms, and characteristics. In this third edition, text remains intimately tied to applications in heat transfer, wave motion, biological systems, and a variety other topics in pure and applied science. The text offers flexibility to instructors who, for example, may wish to insert topics from biology or numerical methods at any time in the course. The exposition is presented in a friendly, easy-to-read, style, with mathematical ideas motivated from physical problems. Many exercises and worked examples have been added to this edition. Prerequisites include calculus and ordinary differential equations. A student who reads this book and works many of the exercises will have a sound knowledge for a second course in partial differential equations or for courses in advanced engineering and science. Two additional chapters include short introductions to applications of PDEs in biology and a new chapter to the computation of solutions. A brief appendix reviews techniques from ordinary differential equations. From the reviews of the second edition: "This second edition of the short undergraduate text provides a fist course in PDE aimed at students in mathematics, engineering and the sciences. The material is standard ... Strong emphasis is put on modeling and applications throughout; the main text is supplied with many examples and exercises." "R. Steinbauer, Monatshefte für Mathematik, Vol. 150 (4), 2007 "This is a unique book in the sense that it provides a coverage of the main topics of the subject in a concise style which is accessible to science and engineering students. ... Reading this book and solving the problems, the students will have a solid base for a course in partial differential equations ... ." "Tibor Krisztin, Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum, Vol. 74, 2008},

The resulting fluid dynamic equations are shown to be consistent for all these derivations, when properly accounting for the respective region of applicability, and can be applied to both weakly and strongly coupled systems. In its modern formulation, relativistic viscous hydrodynamics can directly be solved numerically. This has been useful for the problem of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, and I will review the setup and results of a hydrodynamic description of experimental data for this case.},

	abstract = {Here we present a new approach, called ADER, for constructing non-oscillatory advection schemes of arbitrary order of accuracy in space and time. The main ideas are presented in terms of the one-dimensional linear advection equation. As is well-known from Godunov's theorem [8], the two requirements of (i) high accuracy and (ii) absence of spurious oscillations near discontinuities are contradictory. Solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws are piece-wise smooth, which means that in general they contain smooth parts and discontinuities. Note also that smooth portions of the solution may contain large gradients which, numerically, may be as demanding as discontinuities. A classical way of circumventing Godunov's theorem is to construct non-linear schemes, even when applied to linear problems. A successful class of non-linear schemes are the so-called total Variation Diminishing Methods (or TVD methods) [9], [17] developed over the last two decades or so. Such schemes provide today the basis of a mature numerical technology suitable for industrial and scientific applications [14], [22], [23]. These methods are second-order accurate, almost everywhere, and reduce locally to first-order of accuracy. TVD methods however, are known to be unsuitable for special application areas such as acoustics, compressible turbulence and problems involving long-time evolution wave propagation. Extrema are clipped and numerical dissipation may become dominant The non-oscillatory methods we are attempting to construct here will be of much higher order of accuracy in both space and time and will not impose TVD-like constraints.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a p- version least squares finite element formulation (LSFEF) for two-dimensional, incompressible, non-Newtonian fluid flow under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The dimensionless forms of the diffential equations describing the fluid motion and heat transfer are cast into a set of first-order differential equations using non-Newtonian stresses and heat fluxes as auxiliary variables. The velocities, pressure and temperature as well as the stresses and heat fluxes are interpolated using equal-order, C0-continuous, p-version hierarchical approximation functions. The application of least squares minimization to the set of coupled first-order non-linear partial differential equations results in finding a solution vector δ which makes the partial derivatives of the error functional with respect to δ a null vector. This is accomplished by using Newton's method with a line search. The paper presents the implementation of a power-law model for the non-Newtonian Viscosity. For the non-isothermal case the fluid properties are considered to be a function of temperature. Three numerical examples (fully developed flow between parallel plates, symmetric sudden expansion and lid-driven cavity) are presented for isothermal power-law fluid flow. The Couette shear flow problem and the 4:1 symmetric sudden expansion are used to present numerical results for non-isothermal power-law fluid flow. The numerical examples demonstrate the convergence characteristics and accuracy of the formulation.},

	abstract = {We present the extension of an efficient and highly parallelisable framework for incompressible fluid flow simulations to viscoplastic fluids. The system is governed by incompressible conservation of mass, the Cauchy momentum equation, and a generalised Newtonian constitutive law. In order to simulate a wide range of viscoplastic fluids, we employ the Herschel-Bulkley model for yield-stress fluids with nonlinear stress-strain dependency above the yield limit. We utilise Papanastasiou regularisation in our algorithm to deal with the singularity in apparent viscosity. The resulting system of partial differential equations is solved using the IAMR (Incompressible Adaptive Mesh Refinement) code, which uses second-order Godunov methodology for the advective terms and semi-implicit diffusion in the context of an approximate projection method to solve adaptively refined meshes. By augmenting the IAMR code with the ability to simulate regularised Herschel-Bulkley fluids, we obtain efficient numerical software for time-dependent viscoplastic flow in three dimensions, which can be used to investigate systems not considered previously due to computational expense. We validate results from simulations using this new capability against previously published data for Bingham plastics and power-law fluids in the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. In doing so, we expand the range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers which have been considered in the benchmark tests. Moreover, extensions to time-dependent flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluids and three spatial dimensions offer new insights into the flow of viscoplastic fluids in this test case, and we provide missing benchmark results for these extensions.},

	abstract = {Hyperbolic systems of PDEs can be solved to arbitrary orders of accuracy by using the ADER Finite Volume method. These PDE systems may be non-conservative and non-homogeneous, and contain stiff source terms. ADER-FV requires a spatio-temporal polynomial reconstruction of the data in each spacetime cell, at each time step. This reconstruction is obtained as the root of a nonlinear system, resulting from the use of a Galerkin method. It was proved in [7] that for traditional choices of basis polynomials, the eigenvalues of certain matrices appearing in these nonlinear systems are always 0, regardless of the number of spatial dimensions of the PDEs or the chosen order of accuracy of the ADER-FV method. This guarantees fast convergence to the Galerkin root for certain classes of PDEs. In Montecinos and Balsara [8] a new, more efficient class of basis polynomials for the one-dimensional ADER-FV method was presented. This new class of basis polynomials, originally presented for conservative systems, is extended to multidimensional, non-conservative systems here, and the corresponding property regarding the eigenvalues of the Galerkin matrices is proved.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to introduce methods and concepts of the Riemann-Cartan geometry largely used in such physical theories as general relativity, gauge theories, solid dynamics, etc. to fluid dynamics in general and to studying and modeling turbulence in particular. Thus, we further generalize our unified first-order hyperbolic formulation of continuum fluid and solid mechanics in order to account for rotational degrees of freedom (spin) of the underlying microscopic dynamics. Such a microscopic dynamics can be associated with the dynamics of small-scale eddies in turbulent flows of viscous fluids or dynamics of dislocations continuously distributed in an elastoplastically deformed solid. In order to achieve this, we use the rotational degree of freedom of the main field of the theory, the distortion field, which characterizes the deformation and rotation of the material elements and can be viewed as anholonomic basis triad with the non-vanishing torsion tensor. The torsion tensor is then used to characterize distortion's spin and is treated as an independent field with its own time evolution equation. The resulting governing equations have essentially the structure of the non-linear Maxwell equations in a moving medium. The system is closed by providing an example of the total energy potential. The extended system describes not only dissipative dynamics (which rises the entropy) due to viscosity or plasticity effects but it also has dispersive features which are due to the non-dissipative energy exchange (which conserves the entropy) between micro and macro scales. Both the dissipative and dispersive processes are represented by relaxation-type algebraic source terms so that the overall system remains first-order hyperbolic.},

	abstract = {Impact sensitivity of solid high explosives, an important index in evaluating the safety and performance of explosives, is an important concern in handling, storage, and shipping procedures. It is a great threat for either bare dynamite or shell charge when subjected to low velocity impact involved in traffic accidents or charge piece drops. The Steven test is an effective tool to study the relative sensitivity of various explosives. In this paper, we built the numerical simulation method involving mechanical, thermo and chemical properties of Steven test based on the thermo-mechanical coupled material model. In the model, the stress-strain relationship is described by dynamic plasticity model, the thermal effect of the explosive induced by impact is depicted by isotropic thermal material model, the chemical reaction of explosives is described by Arrhenius reaction rate law, and the effects of heating and melting on mechanical properties and thermal properties of materials are also taken into account. Specific to the standard Steven test, the thermal and mechanical response rules of PBX 9501 at various impact velocities were numerically analyzed, and the threshold velocity of explosive initiation was obtained, which is in good agreement with experimental results. In addition, the effect of confine condition of test device to the threshold velocity was explored.},

	abstract = {We propose a numerical methodology for the numerical simulation of distinct, interacting physical processes described by a combination of compressible, inert and reactive forms of the Euler equations, multiphase equations and elastoplastic equations. These systems of equations are usually solved by coupling finite element and CFD models. Here we solve them simultaneously, by recasting all the equations in the same, hyperbolic form and solving them on the same grid with the same finite-volume numerical schemes. The proposed compressible, multiphase, hydrodynamic formulation can employ a hierarchy of five reactive and non-reactive flow models, which allows simple to more involved applications to be directly described by the appropriate selection. The communication between the hydrodynamic and elastoplastic systems is facilitated by means of mixed-material Riemann solvers at the boundaries of the systems, which represent physical material boundaries. To this end we derive approximate mixed Riemann solvers for each pair of the above models based on characteristic equations. The components for reactive flow and elastoplastic solid modelling are validated separately before presenting validation for the full, coupled systems. Multi-dimensional use cases demonstrate the suitability of the reactive flow-solid interaction methodology in the context of impact-driven initiation of reactive flow and structural response due to violent reaction in automotive (e.g. car crash) or defence (e.g. explosive reactive armour) applications. Several types of explosives (C4, Detasheet, nitromethane, gaseous fuel) in gaseous, liquid and solid state are considered.},

The model involves six equations obtained from conservation principles applied to each phase, completed by a seventh equation for the evolution of the volume fraction. This equation is necessary to close the overall system. The model is valid for fluid mixtures, as well as for pure fluids. The system of partial differential equations is hyperbolic. Hyperbolicity is obtained because each phase is considered to be compressible. Two difficulties arise for the solution: one of the equations is written in non-conservative form; non-conservative terms exist in the momentum and energy equations. We propose robust and accurate discretisation of these terms. The method solves the same system at each mesh point with the same algorithm. It allows the simulation of interface problems between pure fluids as well as multiphase mixtures. Several test cases where fluids have compressible behavior are shown as well as some other test problems where one of the phases is incompressible. The method provides reliable results, is able to compute strong shock waves, and deals with complex equations of state.},

A linearity-preserving, piecewise linear interface geometry approximation ensures that solutions generated retain second-order spatial accuracy. Second-order temporal accuracy is achieved by virtue of a multidimensional unsplit time integration scheme. We detail our geometrically based solution method, in which material volume fluxes are computed systematically with a set of simple geometric tasks. We then interrogate the method by testing its ability to track interfaces through large, controlled topology changes, whereby an initially simple interface configuration is subjected to vortical flows.

	abstract = {A framework for simulating the interactions between multiple different continua is presented. Each constituent material is governed by the same set of equations, differing only in terms of their equations of state and strain dissipation functions. The interfaces between any combination of fluids, solids, and vacuum are handled by a new Riemann Ghost Fluid Method, which is agnostic to the type of material on either side (depending only on the desired boundary conditions). The Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model is used for modelling the continua (having recently been used to solve a range of problems involving Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and elastic and elastoplastic solids), and this study represents the first publically-available method to handle multimaterial problems under this model. The resulting framework is simple, yet capable of accurately reproducing a wide range of different physical scenarios. It is demonstrated here to accurately reproduce analytical results for known Riemann problems, and to produce expected results in other cases, including some featuring heat conduction across interfaces. The framework thus has the potential to streamline development of simulation software for scenarios involving multiple materials and phases of matter, by reducing the number of different systems of equations that require solvers, and cutting down on the amount of theoretical work required to deal with the interfaces between materials.},

Following the same theoretical frame, we derive here an Eulerian diffuse interface model for elastic solid-compressible fluid interactions in situations involving extreme deformations. Elastic effects are included following the Eulerian conservative formulation proposed in Godunov [16], Miller and Colella [23], Godunov and Romenskii [17], Plohr and Plohr [27] and Gavrilyuk et al. [14]. We apply first the Hamilton principle of stationary action to derive the conservative part of the model. The relaxation terms are then added which are compatible with the entropy inequality. In the limit of vanishing volume fractions the Euler equations of compressible fluids and a conservative hyperelastic model are recovered. It is solved by a unique hyperbolic solver valid at each mesh point (pure fluid, pure solid and mixture cell). Capabilities of the model and methods are illustrated on various tests of impacts of solids moving in an ambient compressible fluid.},

The system of governing equations couples Euler equations of compressible fluids and a visco-plastic model of Maxwell type materials (the deviatoric part of the stress tensor decreases during plastic deformations) in the same manner as models of multicomponent fluids. In particular, the model is able to create interfaces which were not present initially. The model is thermodynamically compatible: it verifies the entropy inequality. However, a numerical treatment of the model is particularly challenging. Indeed, the model is non-conservative, so a special numerical splitting is proposed to overcome this difficulty. The numerical algorithm contains two relaxation procedures. One of them is physical and is related to the plastic relaxation mechanism (relaxation toward the yield surface). The second one is numerical. It consists in replacing the algebraic equation expressing a mechanical equilibrium between components by a partial differential equation with a short relaxation time. The numerical method was tested in 1D case (Wilkins’ flying plate problem), 2D plane case (impact of a projectile on a plate) and axisymmetrical case (Taylor test problem, impact with penetration effects, etc.). Numerical examples show the ability of the model to deal with real physical phenomena.},

	abstract = {We extend the model of diffuse solid–fluid interfaces developed earlier by authors of this paper to the case of arbitrary number of interacting hyperelastic solids. Plastic transformations of solids are taken into account through a Maxwell type model. The specific energy of each solid is given in separable form: it is the sum of a hydrodynamic part of the energy depending only on the density and the entropy, and an elastic part of the energy which is unaffected by the volume change. It allows us to naturally pass to the fluid description in the limit of vanishing shear modulus. In spite of a large number of governing equations, the model has a quite simple mathematical structure: it is a duplication of a single visco-elastic model. The model is well posed both mathematically and thermodynamically: it is hyperbolic and compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. The resulting model can be applied in the situations involving an arbitrary number of fluids and solids. In particular, we show the ability of the model to describe spallation and penetration phenomena occurring during high velocity impacts.},

Second, a new approach based on unified description of fluids and solids (SHTC approach in the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics). We will study singular limits, interaction of rigid body with inviscid fluid, fluids with elastic boundary. We will consider both incompressible and compressible fluids, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and also mixtures. The models will be analyzed by methods of the theory of partial differential equations. New and classical numerical schemes will be investigated and all problems will be solved numerically. Both approaches will be compared at all levels. The proposed project assumes a tight cooperation of specialists from various fields of mathematics.},

At the operating point of current devices, real gas effects already become relevant, for example in the determination of mass flow rates. These effects have to be considered in the design process of such components. Motivated by this fact, we investigate the real gas effects of high-pressure supersonic methane jets. A discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for computational fluid dynamics is used in combination with a tabulated equation of state for methane. We first evaluate self-similar profiles for subsonic jets to validate our simulation approach. Then we discuss our simulations of a supersonic jet, where we observe well-resolved shocks and transient structures. Additionally, real and ideal gas modeling are compared and we discuss the significant differences in general flow structure as well as density, pressure and mass flow that occur and make an ideal-gas description inappropriate for our simulation. The influence of pressure level and temperature on the behavior of the jet is discussed. We analyze the influence of the thermodynamic and viscous properties of the gas for the shock location and mass flow. The use of a tabulated equation of state makes jet simulations with occurring phase changes possible.},

Solids 67, 2033 (2006)), but extends the range of densities and temperatures covered to 10-5-105 g/cc and 0-108K. The staticlattice cold curve is modeled using the semi-empirical stabilized jellium equation near ambient densities, LDA and GGA density-functional predictions at moderate compressions, and ThomasFermi-Dirac theory at high compressions. The Johnson ionic model, which smoothly interpolates between Debye-like and ideal-gas behavior, is employed to model contributions from atomic motion, and Thomas-Fermi-Dirac theory is used for contributions from thermal electronic excitations. Predictions for the compressibility, principle and porous shock Hugoniot, thermal expansion, heat capacity, and melt line are compared with experimental data.},

The schemes may thus be viewed as Godunov methods of very high order of accuracy. We present the ADER formulation for the linear advection equation with constant coefficients, in one and multiple space dimensions. Some preliminary ideas for extending the approach to non-linear problems are also discussed. Numerical results for one and two-dimensional problems using schemes of upto 10-th order accuracy are presented.},

Firstly, the governing equations include nonlinear advection as well as reaction terms and, secondly, the initial condition consists of two arbitrary but infinitely differentiable functions, an assumption that is consistent with piecewise smooth solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws. The solution procedure, local and valid for sufficiently small times, reduces the solution of the generalized Riemann problem of the inhomogeneous nonlinear equations to that of solving a sequence of conventional Riemann problems for homogeneous advection equations for spatial derivatives of the initial conditions. We illustrate the approach via the model advection - reaction equation, the inhomogeneous Burgers equation and the nonlinear shallow-water equations with variable bed elevation.},

To compute the intercell flux in one space dimension we solve a generalised Riemann problem by reducing it to the solution a sequence of m conventional Riemann problems for the kth spatial derivatives of the solution, with k = 0, 1,…, m-1, where m is arbitrary and is the order of the accuracy of the resulting scheme.
