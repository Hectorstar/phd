abstract = {The present paper introduces a class of finite volume schemes of increasing order of accuracy in space and time for hyperbolic systems that are in conservation form. The methods are specially suited for efficient implementation on structured meshes. The hyperbolic system is required to be non-stiff. This paper specifically focuses on Euler system that is used for modeling the flow of neutral fluids and the divergence-free, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system that is used for large scale modeling of ionized plasmas. Efficient techniques for weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) interpolation have been developed for finite volume reconstruction on structured meshes. We have shown that the most elegant and compact formulation of WENO reconstruction obtains when the interpolating functions are expressed in modal space. Explicit formulae have been provided for schemes having up to fourth order of spatial accuracy. Divergence-free evolution of magnetic fields requires the magnetic field components and their moments to be defined in the zone faces. We draw on a reconstruction strategy developed recently by the first author to show that a high order specification of the magnetic field components in zone-faces naturally furnishes an appropriately high order representation of the magnetic field within the zone. We also present a new formulation of the ADER (for Arbitrary Derivative Riemann Problem) schemes that relies on a local continuous space-time Galerkin formulation instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure. We call such schemes ADER-CG and show that a very elegant and compact formulation results when the scheme is formulated in modal space. Explicit formulae have been provided on structured meshes for ADER-CG schemes in three dimensions for all orders of accuracy that extend up to fourth order. Such ADER schemes have been used to temporally evolve the WENO-based spatial reconstruction. The resulting ADER-WENO schemes provide temporal accuracy that matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying WENO reconstruction. In this paper we have also provided a point-wise description of ADER-WENO schemes for divergence-free MHD in a fashion that facilitates computer implementation. The schemes reported here have all been implemented in the RIEMANN framework for computational astrophysics. All the methods presented have a one-step update, making them low-storage alternatives to the usual Runge-Kutta time-discretization. Their one-step update also makes them suitable building blocks for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) calculations. We demonstrate that the ADER-WENO meet their design accuracies. Several stringent test problems of Euler flows and MHD flows are presented in one, two and three dimensions. Many of our test problems involve near infinite shocks in multiple dimensions and the higher order schemes are shown to perform very robustly and accurately under all conditions. It is shown that the increasing computational complexity with increasing order is handily offset by the increased accuracy of the scheme. The resulting ADER-WENO schemes are, therefore, very worthy alternatives to the standard second order schemes for compressible Euler and MHD flow. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper is devoted to developing a multi-material numerical scheme for non-linear elastic solids, with emphasis on the inclusion of interfacial boundary conditions. In particular for colliding solid objects it is desirable to allow large deformations and relative slide, whilst employing fixed grids and maintaining sharp interfaces. Existing schemes utilising interface tracking methods such as volume-of-fluid typically introduce erroneous transport of tangential momentum across material boundaries. Aside from combatting these difficulties one can also make improvements in a numerical scheme for multiple compressible solids by utilising governing models that facilitate application of high-order shock capturing methods developed for hydrodynamics. A numerical scheme that simultaneously allows for sliding boundaries and utilises such high-order shock capturing methods has not yet been demonstrated. A scheme is proposed here that directly addresses these challenges by extending a ghost cell method for gas-dynamics to solid mechanics, by using a first-order model for elastic materials in conservative form. Interface interactions are captured using the solution of a multi-material Riemann problem which is derived in detail. Several different boundary conditions are considered including solid/solid and solid/vacuum contact problems. Interfaces are tracked using level-set functions. The underlying single material numerical method includes a characteristic based Riemann solver and high-order WENO reconstruction. Numerical solutions of example multi-material problems are provided in comparison to exact solutions for the one-dimensional augmented system, and for a two-dimensional friction experiment. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper a new, simple and universal formulation of the HLLEM Riemann solver (RS) is proposed that works for general conservative and non-conservative systems of hyperbolic equations. For non-conservative PDE, a path-conservative formulation of the HLLEM RS is presented for the first time in this paper. The HLLEM Riemann solver is built on top of a novel and very robust path-conservative HLL method. It thus naturally inherits the positivity properties and the entropy enforcement of the underlying HLL scheme. However, with just the slight additional cost of evaluating eigenvectors and eigenvalues of intermediate characteristic fields, we can represent linearly degenerate intermediate waves with a minimum of smearing.For conservative systems, our paper provides the easiest and most seamless path for taking a pre-existing HLL RS and quickly and effortlessly converting it to a RS that provides improved results, comparable with those of an HLLC, HLLD, Osher or Roe-type RS. This is done with minimal additional computational complexity, making our variant of the HLLEM RS also a very fast RS that can accurately represent linearly degenerate discontinuities. Our present HLLEM RS also transparently extends these advantages to non-conservative systems. For shallow water-type systems, the resulting method is proven to be well-balanced.Several test problems are presented for shallow water-type equations and two-phase flow models, as well as for gas dynamics with real equation of state, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD {\&} RMHD), and nonlinear elasticity.Since our new formulation accommodates multiple intermediate waves and has a broader applicability than the original HLLEM method, it could alternatively be called the HLLI Riemann solver, where the "I" stands for the intermediate characteristic fields that can be accounted for.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of the unified first order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics recently proposed by Peshkov and Romenski [110], further denoted as HPR model. In that framework, the viscous stresses are computed from the so-called distortion tensor A, which is one of the primary state variables in the proposed first order system. A very important key feature of the HPR model is its ability to describe at the same time the behavior of inviscid and viscous compressible Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with heat conduction, as well as the behavior of elastic and visco-plastic solids. Actually, the model treats viscous and inviscid fluids as generalized visco-plastic solids. This is achieved via a stiff source term that accounts for strain relaxation in the evolution equations of A. Also heat conduction is included via a first order hyperbolic system for the thermal impulse, from which the heat flux is computed. The governing PDE system is hyperbolic and fully consistent with the first and the second principle of thermodynamics. It is also fundamentally different from first order Maxwell-Cattaneo-type relaxation models based on extended irreversible thermodynamics. The HPR model represents therefore a novel and unified description of continuum mechanics, which applies at the same time to fluid mechanics and solid mechanics. In this paper, the direct connection between the HPR model and the classical hyperbolic-parabolic Navier-Stokes-Fourier theory is established for the first time via a formal asymptotic analysis in the stiff relaxation limit.From a numerical point of view, the governing partial differential equations are very challenging, since they form a large nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system that includes stiff source terms and non-conservative products. We apply the successful family of one-step ADER-WENO finite volume (FV) and ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes to the HPR model in the stiff relaxation limit, and compare the numerical results with exact or numerical reference solutions obtained for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical convergence results are also provided. To show the universality of the HPR model, the paper is rounded-off with an application to wave propagation in elastic solids, for which one only needs to switch off the strain relaxation source term in the governing PDE system.We provide various examples showing that for the purpose of flow visualization, the distortion tensor A seems to be particularly useful.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new unified first order hyperbolic model of Newtonian continuum mechanics coupled with electro-dynamics. The model is able to describe the behavior of moving elasto-plastic dielec- tric solids as well as viscous and inviscid fluids in the presence of electro-magnetic fields. It is actually a very peculiar feature of the proposed PDE system that viscous fluids are treated just as a special case of elasto-plastic solids. This is achieved by introducing a strain relaxation mechanism in the evolution equa- tions of the distortion matrix A, which in the case of purely elastic solids maps the current configuration to the reference configuration. The model also contains a hyperbolic formulation of heat conduction as well as a dissipative source term in the evolution equations for the electric field given by Ohm's law. Via formal asymptotic analysis we show that in the stiff limit, the governing first order hyperbolic PDE system with re- laxation source terms tends asymptotically to the well-known viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. Furthermore, a rigorous derivation of the model from variational principles is presented, together with the transformation of the Euler-Lagrange differential equations associated with the underlying variational problem from Lagrangian coordinates to Eulerian coordinates in a fixed laboratory frame. The present paper hence extends the unified first order hyperbolic model of Newtonian continuum mechanics re- cently proposed in [79, 28] to the more general case where the continuum is coupled with electro-magnetic fields. The governing PDE system is symmetric hyperbolic and satisfies the first and second principle of thermodynamics, hence it belongs to the so-called class of symmetric hyperbolic thermodynamically com- patible systems (HTC), which have been studied for the first time by Godunov in 1961 [44] and later in a series of papers by Godunov and Romenski [49, 51, 84]. An important feature of the proposed model is that the propagation speeds of all physical processes, including dissipative processes, are finite. The model is discretized using high order accurate ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes with a posteriori subcell finite volume limiter and using high order ADER-WENO finite volume schemes. We show numerical test problems that explore a rather large parameter space of the model ranging from ideal MHD, viscous and resistive MHD over pure electro-dynamics to moving dielectric elastic solids in a magnetic field.},

abstract = {We propose a simple extension of the well-known Riemann solver of Osher and Solomon (Math. Comput. 38:339–374, 1982) to a certain class of hyperbolic systems in non-conservative form, in particular to shallow-water-type and multi-phase flow models. To this end we apply the formalism of path-conservative schemes introduced by Par{\'{e}}s (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 44:300–321, 2006) and Castro et al. (Math. Comput. 75:1103–1134, 2006). For the sake of generality and simplicity, we suggest to compute the inherent path integral numerically using a Gaussian quadrature rule of sufficient accuracy. Published pathconservative schemes to date are based on either the Roe upwind method or on centered approaches. In comparison to these, the proposed new path-conservative Osher-type scheme has several advantages. First, it does not need an entropy fix, in contrast to Roe-type pathconservative schemes. Second, our proposed non-conservative Osher scheme is very simple to implement and nonetheless constitutes a complete Riemann solver in the sense that it attributes a different numerical viscosity to each characteristic field present in the relevant Riemann problem; this is in contrast to centered methods or incomplete Riemann solvers that usually neglect intermediate characteristic fields, hence leading to excessive numerical diffusion. Finally, the interface jump term is differentiable with respect to its arguments, which is useful for steady-state computations in implicit schemes. We also indicate how to extend the method to general unstructured meshes in multiple space dimensions. We show applications of the first order version of the proposed path-conservative Osher-type scheme to the shallow water equations with variable bottom topography and to the two-fluid debris flow model of Pitman {\&} Le. Then, we apply the higher-order multi-dimensional version of the method to the Baer–Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flow. We also clearly emphasize the limitations of our approach in a special chapter at the end of this article.},

High order spatial accuracy is obtained through a WENO reconstruction, while a high order one-step time discretization is achieved using a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method. Due to the one-step nature of the underlying scheme, the resulting algorithm is particularly well suited for an AMR strategy on space-time adaptive meshes, i.e. with time-accurate local time stepping. The AMR property has been implemented 'cell-by-cell', with a standard tree-type algorithm, while the scheme has been parallelized via the message passing interface (MPI) paradigm. The new scheme has been tested over a wide range of examples for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, including the classical Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). High order in space and time have been confirmed via a numerical convergence study and a detailed analysis of the computational speed-up with respect to highly refined uniform meshes is also presented. We also show test problems where the presented high order AMR scheme behaves clearly better than traditional second order AMR methods. The proposed scheme that combines for the first time high order ADER methods with space-time adaptive grids in two and three space dimensions is likely to become a useful tool in several fields of computational physics, applied mathematics and mechanics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The review of the development of V{\&}V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V{\&}V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors' contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V{\&}V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V{\&}V in production and commercial software.},

abstract = {On the example of two-phase continua experiencing stress-induced solid--fluid phase transitions, we explore the use of the Euler structure in the formulation of the governing equations. The Euler structure guarantees that solutions of the time evolution equations possessing it are compatible with mechanics and with thermodynamics. The former compatibility means that the equations are local conservation laws of the Godunov type, and the latter compatibility means that the entropy does not decrease during the time evolution. In numerical illustrations, in which the one-dimensional Riemann problem is explored, we require that the Euler structure is also preserved in the discretization.},

@article{Peshkov2016,
abstract = {We discuss a pure hyperbolic alternative to the Navier–Stokes equations, which are of parabolic type. As a result of the substitution of the concept of the viscosity coefficient by a microphysics-based temporal characteristic, particle settled life (PSL) time, it becomes possible to formulate a model for viscous fluids in a form of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations. Moreover, the concept of PSL time allows the use of the same model for flows of viscous fluids (Newtonian or non-Newtonian) as well as irreversible deformation of solids. In the theory presented, a continuum is interpreted as a system of material particles connected by bonds; the internal resistance to flow is interpreted as elastic stretching of the particle bonds; and a flow is a result of bond destructions and rearrangements of particles. Finally, we examine the model for simple shear flows, arbitrary incompressible and compressible flows of Newtonian fluids and demonstrate that Newton's viscous law can be obtained in the framework of the developed hyperbolic theory as a steady-state limit. A basic relation between the viscosity coefficient, PSL time, and the shear sound velocity is also obtained.},

@article{Zanotti2016,
abstract = {We present a new version of conservative ADER-WENO finite volume schemes, in which both the high order spatial reconstruction as well as the time evolution of the reconstruction polynomials in the local space-time predictor stage are performed in primitive variables, rather than in conserved ones. To obtain a conservative method, the underlying finite volume scheme is still written in terms of the cell averages of the conserved quantities. Therefore, our new approach performs the spatial WENO reconstruction twice:the first WENO reconstruction is carried out on the known cell averages of the conservative variables. TheWENO polynomials are then used at the cell centers to compute point values of the conserved variables, which are subsequently converted into point values of the primitive variables. This is the only place where the conversion from conservative to primitive variables is needed in the new scheme. Then, a second WENO reconstruction is performed on the point values of the primitive variables to obtain piecewise high order reconstruction polynomials of the primitive variables. The reconstruction polynomials are subsequently evolved in time with a novel space-time finite element predictor that is directly applied to the governing PDE written in primitive form. The resulting space-time polynomials of the primitive variables can then be directly used as input for the numerical fluxes at the cell boundaries in the underlying conservative finite volume scheme. Hence, the number of necessary conversions fromthe conserved to the primitive variables is reduced to just one single conversion at each cell center.We have verified the validity of the new approach over a wide range of hyperbolic systems, including the classical Euler equations of gas dynamics, the special relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) and ideal magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) equations, as well as the Baer-Nunziato model for compressible two-phase flows. In all cases we have noticed that the new ADER schemes provide less oscillatory solutions when compared to ADER finite volume schemes based on the reconstruction in conserved variables, especially for the RMHD and the Baer-Nunziato equations. For the RHD and RMHD equations, the overall accuracy is improved and the CPU time is reduced by about 25{\%}. Because of its increased accuracy and due to the reduced computational cost, we recommend to use this version of ADER as the standard one in the relativistic framework. At the end of the paper, the new approach has also been extended to ADER-DG schemes on space-time adaptive grids (AMR).},
