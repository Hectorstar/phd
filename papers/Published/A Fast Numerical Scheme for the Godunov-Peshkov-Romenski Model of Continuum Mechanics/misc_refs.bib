abstract = {Exact one-dimensional solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics are derived in the large-Pr and small-Pr limits (where Pr is the Prandtl number). The solutions are analogous to the Pr = 3/4 solution discovered by Becker and analytically capture the profile of shock fronts in ideal gases. The large-Pr solution is very similar to Becker's solution, differing only by a scale factor. The small-Pr solution is qualitatively different, with an embedded isothermal shock occurring above a critical Mach number. Solutions are derived for constant viscosity and conductivity as well as for the case in which conduction is provided by a radiation field. For a completely general density- and temperature-dependent viscosity and conductivity, the system of equations in all three limits can be reduced to quadrature. The maximum error in the analytical solutions when compared to a numerical integration of the finite-Pr equations is O(1/Pr) for large Pr and O(Pr) for small Pr.},
