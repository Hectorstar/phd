  abstract                 = {In this article, a conservative least-squares polynomial reconstruction operator is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin method. In a first instance, piecewise polynomials of degree N are used as test functions as well as to represent the data in each element at the beginning of a time step. The time evolution of these data and the flux computation, however, are then done with a different set of piecewise polynomials of degree M ??? N, which are reconstructed from the underlying polynomials of degree N. This approach yields a general, unified framework that contains as two special cases classical high order finite volume (FV) schemes (N = 0) as well as the usual discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method (N = M). In the first case, the polynomial is reconstructed from cell averages, for the latter, the reconstruction reduces to the identity operator. A completely new class of numerical schemes is generated by choosing N ??? 0 and M {\textgreater} N. The reconstruction operator is implemented for arbitrary polynomial degrees N and M on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes in two and three space dimensions. To provide a high order accurate one-step time integration of the same formal order of accuracy as the spatial discretization operator, the (reconstructed) polynomial data of degree M are evolved in time locally inside each element using a new local continuous space-time Galerkin method. As a result of this approach, we obtain, as a high order accurate predictor, space-time polynomials for the vector of conserved variables and for the physical fluxes and source terms, which then can be used in a natural way to construct very efficient fully-discrete and quadrature-free one-step schemes. This feature is particularly important for DG schemes in three space dimensions, where the cost of numerical quadrature may become prohibitively expensive for very high orders of accuracy. Numerical convergence studies of all members of the new general class of proposed schemes are shown up to sixth-order of accuracy in space and time on unstructured two- and three-dimensional meshes for two very prominent nonlinear hyperbolic systems, namely for the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The results indicate that the new class of intermediate schemes (N ??? 0, M {\textgreater} N) is computationally more efficient than classical finite volume or DG schemes. Finally, a large set of interesting test cases is solved on unstructured meshes, where the proposed new time stepping approach is applied to the equations of ideal and relativistic MHD as well as to nonlinear elasticity, using a standard high order WENO finite volume discretization in space to cope with discontinuous solutions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {We develop a new family of well-balanced path-conservative quadrature-free one-step ADER finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured meshes for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations with non-conservative products and stiff source terms. The fully discrete formulation is derived using the recently developed framework of explicit one-step PN PM schemes of arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and time for conservative hyperbolic systems [Dumbser M, Balsara D, Toro EF, Munz CD. A unified framework for the construction of one-step finite-volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes. J Comput Phys 2008;227:8209-53]. The two key ingredients of our high order approach are: first, the high order accurate PN PM reconstruction operator on unstructured meshes, using the WENO strategy presented in [Dumbser M, K??ser M, Titarev VA Toro EF. Quadrature-free non-oscillatory finite volume schemes on unstructured meshes for nonlinear hyperbolic systems. J Comput Phys 2007;226:204-43] to ensure monotonicity at discontinuities, and second, a local space-time Galerkin scheme to predict the evolution of the reconstructed polynomial data inside each element during one time step to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization. This approach is also able to deal with stiff source terms as shown in [Dumbser M, Enaux C, Toro EF. Finite volume schemes of very high order of accuracy for stiff hyperbolic balance laws. J Comput Phys 2008;227:3971-4001]. These two key ingredients are combined with the recently developed path-conservative methods of Par??s [Par??s C. Numerical methods for nonconservative hyperbolic systems: a theoretical framework. SIAM J Numer Anal 2006;44:300-21] and Castro et al. [Castro MJ, Gallardo JM, Par??s C. High-order finite volume schemes based on reconstruction of states for solving hyperbolic systems with nonconservative products. Applications to shallow-water systems. Math Comput 2006;75:1103-34] to treat the non-conservative products properly. We show applications of our method to the two-layer shallow water equations as well as applications to the recently published depth-averaged two-fluid flow model of Pitman and Le [Pitman EB, Le L.

The resulting algorithm, which is particularly well suited for the treatment of material interfaces in compressible multi-phase flows, is based on: (i) high order of accuracy in space obtained through WENO reconstruction, (ii) a high order one-step time discretization via a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method, and (iii) the use of a path conservative scheme for handling the non-conservative terms of the equations. The AMR property with time accurate local time stepping, which has been treated according to a cell-by-cell strategy, strongly relies on the high order one-step time discretization, which naturally allows a high order accurate and consistent computation of the jump terms at interfaces between elements using different time steps. The new scheme has been successfully validated on some test problems for the Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multiphase flows. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we propose the first better than second order accurate method in space and time for the numerical solution of the resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RRMHD) equations on unstructured meshes in multiple space dimensions. The nonlinear system under consideration is purely hyperbolic and contains a source term, the one for the evolution of the electric field, that becomes stiff for low values of the resistivity. For the spatial discretization we propose to use high order PN PM schemes as introduced in Dumbser et al. [M. Dumbser, D. Balsara, E.F. Toro, C.D. Munz, A unified framework for the construction of one-step finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes, Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2008) 8209-8253] for hyperbolic conservation laws and a high order accurate unsplit time-discretization is achieved using the element-local space-time discontinuous Galerkin approach proposed in Dumbser et al. [M. Dumbser, C. Enaux, E.F. Toro, Finite volume schemes of very high order of accuracy for stiff hyperbolic balance laws, Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2008) 3971-4001] for one-dimensional balance laws with stiff source terms. The divergence-free character of the magnetic field is accounted for through the divergence cleaning procedure of Dedner et al. [A. Dedner, F. Kemm, D. Kr??ner, C.-D. Munz, T. Schnitzer, M. Wesenberg, Hyperbolic divergence cleaning for the MHD equations, Journal of Computational Physics 175 (2002) 645-673]. To validate our high order method we first solve some numerical test cases for which exact analytical reference solutions are known and we also show numerical convergence studies in the stiff limit of the RRMHD equations using PN PM schemes from third to fifth order of accuracy in space and time. We also present some applications with shock waves such as a classical shock tube problem with different values for the conductivity as well as a relativistic MHD rotor problem and the relativistic equivalent of the Orszag-Tang vortex problem. We have verified that the proposed method can handle equally well the resistive regime and the stiff limit of ideal relativistic MHD. For these reasons it provides a powerful tool for relativistic astrophysical simulations involving the appearance of magnetic reconnection. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

High order spatial accuracy is obtained through a WENO reconstruction, while a high order one-step time discretization is achieved using a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method. Due to the one-step nature of the underlying scheme, the resulting algorithm is particularly well suited for an AMR strategy on space-time adaptive meshes, i.e. with time-accurate local time stepping. The AMR property has been implemented 'cell-by-cell', with a standard tree-type algorithm, while the scheme has been parallelized via the message passing interface (MPI) paradigm. The new scheme has been tested over a wide range of examples for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, including the classical Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). High order in space and time have been confirmed via a numerical convergence study and a detailed analysis of the computational speed-up with respect to highly refined uniform meshes is also presented. We also show test problems where the presented high order AMR scheme behaves clearly better than traditional second order AMR methods. The proposed scheme that combines for the first time high order ADER methods with space-time adaptive grids in two and three space dimensions is likely to become a useful tool in several fields of computational physics, applied mathematics and mechanics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},
