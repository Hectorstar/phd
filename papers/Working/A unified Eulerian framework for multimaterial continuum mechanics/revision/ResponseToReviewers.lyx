0) In the abstract: it is better to relax the line "...this study represents
 the first publicly-available method to handle multimaterial problems under
 this model" because there are papers at least by Angelo Iollo et al (e.g.
 see references in the introduction of Peshkov et al, 2019, JCP, "Theoretical
 and numerical comparison of hyperelastic and hypoelastic formulations for
 Eulerian non-linear elastoplasticity", https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.02.039))
 who use a very similar PDE system (for the distortion A but without the
 heat conduction) and the level set method for multimaterial modeling.
 However, it seems that they are not aware that these PDEs can be applied
 to the modeling of viscous flows as well.
 The authors could also mention the papers by Illo et al, e.g.
 refs.
 [25],[26] from the mentioned paper by Peshkov et al.
 I leave it up to the authors.

The line has been relaxed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

this study represents a novel approach for handling multimaterial problems
 under this model
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (page 1).
 The references mentioned here are now discussed in 1.1 Multimaterial Models
 (page 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) The line before eq.
 (1a), in references "...(see [33], [12], [8])": it is worth to add the mentioned
 above paper by Peshkov et al in JCP because it contains a review of Eulerian
 approaches to nonlinear elastoplasticity including the GPR model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This additional reference has been added (page 2).

\begin_layout Standard
2) Even though the non-Newtonian fluids are not considered here, I suggest
 adding an expression for 
\backslash
tau_1 in (8a) for non-Newtonian fluids from authors' recent paper, Ref.[22]
 (recently accepted in JCP, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.02.025).
 This will emphasize even more the multimaterial capabilities of the approach.

This has been added (page 5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) I believe, the quasilinear form from the footnote on p.12 should be placed
 right at the beginning of Sec.2.1.
 Otherwise, the meaning of M matrix in eq.(38) is not clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
This has been done (page 14).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4) In eq.(29), say what the matrix L is.
 Should be the left eigenvectors but still, the authors should explicitly
 mention this.
 Later in the text, it is indeed named the left eigenvectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
Before (29), it is already stated: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

[...] analysis yields the left eigenvectors as the rows of (29)
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 This statement has been made more prominent on the page (page 16).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5) Wherever the dots appear in the matrices, like in (37), (40b), an so
 on, it should be declared what these dots stand for.

This notation has been removed by defining new temporary variables (pages
 24,25).

6) Sec.2.2.2.
 Please give a short explanation for the intention of this section.

7) A few lines have to be devoted to the scheme which is used outside of
 the interface, e.g.
 the order of the scheme, the type, etc.
\end_layout

A comprehensive description of the scheme is now given in section 1.4 (pages
 9-13).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8) In Sec.3.3, it is not clear to which of the previously mentioned EOS "the
 Godunov-Romenski EOS" is referenced to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

All four EOS used in this study are now stated explicitly in section 1.2
 (pages 4,5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
9) In Sec.3.8, it is better to reference the line "One can clearly see the
 separation between the elastic precursor wave and the trailing plastic
 wave..." to Fig.17 but not to Fig.16.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This change has been made (page 36).

Reviewer 2

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Background: The authors need to give more informations about the GPR model.
 A self consistent paper is always easier to read.
 Moreover, the GPR model is far from being a well established model.
 The authors should also explain in what extent this model encompasses both
 fluid and solid modellings.
 They have also to answer the crucial question of materials characterized
 by tabulated equations of state.
 Another question is related to the choice of entropy variable to express
 the energies E1 and E2.
 The choice of entropy renders quite difficult the simulation of materials
 response whose parameters, such as the shear modulus, depend on temperature.
 The reviewers asks the authors to address these questions.
 Finally, the reviewer wonders why the authors are not aware of the works
 of Gavrilyuk and Favrie about the numerical modelling of multimaterial
 flows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
A more thorough explanation of the GPR model has been given in section 1.2,
 and a description of the way in which it handles both fluid and solid modeling
 has been provided (pages 3-5).
 The question of tabulated equations of state has been addressed in this
 section (page 5), and the ability to use other variables for E1 and E2
 - rather than entropy - has been discussed (page 5).
 The work of Gavrilyuk and Favrie is now rightfully noted and discussed
 in section 1.1 (page 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 A Riemann ghost fluidâ€¦: The multimaterial treatment in the Eulerian framework
 proposed by the authors is the ghost fluid method.
 More precisely, they promote an improvement of this approach based on an
 approximate Riemann solver of the GPR model.
 This is the main contribution of the paper which is quite difficult to
 read and understand.
 The reviewer believes that the readability of the paper could be dramatically
 improved by rewriting this part.
 The authors have first to explain properly what they want to do: i) recalling
 the system of PDEs to be discretized ; ii) meshing the computational domain
 ; iii) discretizing the PDEs (space, time explicit/implicit???) ; iv) addressin
g the multimaterial treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
All of these suggestions have now been incorporated into the text, in section
 1.4 (pages 9-13).
 The readability of section 2 has been improved by restructuring the text,
 adding extra explanations of variables and derivations where appropriate,
 and removing notation that is not entirely standardized (pages 14-25).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Results: The authors should explain how they have computed the analytical
 solutions.
 The results displayed for test 3.5 in Figure 12 for the heat flux are not
 correct.
 At the material interface, the heat flux has to be continuous, at least
 its normal component.
 The authors should check whether or not their numerical method ensures
 the continuity of the normal heat flux at material interfaces.
 A majority of 1D test cases is provided and 2 2D planar test cases are
 given which is not enough.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
An explanation for the derivation of each analytical solution has been added
 (applicable to sections 3.1-3.5) (pages 26,29).
 The aberrations in the heat flux around the interface present in Figure
 12 have been noted in section 3.5 (page 33) and discussed at some length
 in section 4.2 (page 44).
 Three more multidimensional test cases (including more material pairings
 than before, and reactive species) have been provided in 3.8-3.10 (pages
 36, 40-43), and a convergence study has been provided in section 3.11 (pages
 40,41).

Reviewer 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please give a definitions for all variables used in the GPR model (1a)-(1e).
 Even though some quantities are standard (like density and velocity), the
 distortion tensor A is definitely a non-classical object, which is of crucial
 important in the model description.
 Therefore, I suggest to properly address all quantities appearing in (1a)-(1e).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
This has been done (page 3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please give also explicit formulae for the equation of state used in Section
 3.
 It is not clear what the parameters contained in Table 1 refer to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
All three EOS used in this study are now stated explicitly in section 1.2
 (pages 4,5).

What is tensor 
\backslash
Sigma^*? It seems to appear for the first time in equation (47a)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
This has been clarified (page 20).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Could you please give an explicit formula of the discretization of the governing
 equations? I suppose you use a finite volume scheme, so please write the
 numerical scheme for all equations.
 How do you compute the time step? Nothing is said about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
A comprehensive description of the scheme is now given in section 1.4 (pages
 9-13).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 10, density panel: there is a lowering in the density distribution
 at the right boundary.
 Do you have any explanation? How do you impose physical boundary conditions
 (not interface BCs)? Some comments should be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
This effect is discussed in the text.
 The lowering in the density corresponds to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

heating errors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 discussed in Barton & Drikakis 2010.
 It is reassuring to see that under the GPR system with heat conduction,
 this effect disappears, as explained in the text.
 Artificial physical BCs - such as those used in the aforementioned paper
 - are unnecessary, as explained.
 This discussion has been made more prominent in the paper (page 29).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures 10-11: these results refer to Section 3.4, where the physical domain
 is taken to be [0,1].
 Why do you plot all figures in the range [0,0.65-0.7]? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
The region [0.65-1] is empty, as it is occupied by vacuum.
 The plots are made over [0,0.7] to give greater resolution to the region
 of interest.
 This has been clarified in the text (page 29).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Could you provide a convergence study of your scheme? I assume it is first
 order in space and time, but nothing is said about it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\color blue
A convergence study has been added to section 3.11 (pages 40,41).
