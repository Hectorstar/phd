In this regard, the ghost fluid method has been successfully used to capture the interface conditions for bothfluid fluid and solid fluid interfaces. However, the ghost fluid method results in over/underheating errors when shocks impact interfaces, and hence must be supplemented with numerical corrective measures to mitigate these errors. Such corrections typically fail for strong shock applications. Variantsand extensions of the ghostfluidmethod have been proposed toremedy its shortcomings with mixed success. In this paper, the performance of approaches based on the ghost fluid method, in the case of strong shocks impinging on immersed solid boundaries in compressible flows, is evaluated. It is found that (from the viewpoint of simplicity, robustness, and accuracy) a reflective boundary condition used in conjunction with a local Riemann solver at the interface proves to be a good choice. The method is found to be stable, accurate, and robust for wide range problems involving strong shocks interacting with embedded solid objects.},

The required reconstruction of mixed cell volume fractions and cut cell geometries is presented in detail using the level-set fields. High-order accuracy is achieved by incorporating the weighted-essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method and Runge-Kutta time integration.

It has been found that such GFMs encounter many difficulties when applied to shock impedance matching (-like) problems due to the inability of accurately imposing interfacial conditions.

The step is placed at the same location where the flow variables are initially discontinuous. While the solutions found are still a superposition of travelling waves belonging to the two well-known families of the shallow water system, namely hydraulic jumps and rarefactions, the appearance of a standing discontinuity at the step position produces a very interesting solution pattern. This is mainly due to the asymmetry introduced by the step. The adopted solution procedure combines the basic theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws together with a sound interpretation of the physical concepts embedded in the shallow water system. This finally leads to a set of algebraic equations that must be iteratively solved. The ideas contained in this paper may be of valuable help to the understanding of the behaviour of the SWE with source terms, that constitute the core of many mathematical models for free surface flow simulation.},

This is of interest, for example, when considering the effect of underwater explosions on the hull of a ship or the impact of a low speed projectile on a soft explosive target. On the one hand, high-speed fluid flows are traditionally modeled by applying shock-capturing schemes to the compressible Euler equations to avoid problems associated with tangling of a Lagrangian mesh. On the other hand, solid dynamics calculations are traditionally carried out using Lagrangian numerical methods to avoid problems associated with numerical smearing in Eulerian calculations. We use the ghost fluid method to create accurate discretizations across the Eulerian/Lagrangian interface. The numerical method is presented in both one and two spatial dimensions; three-dimensional extensions (to the interface coupling method) are straightforward.},

abstract = {Ever since the time of Chorin's classic 1968 paper on projection methods, there have been lingering and poorly understood issues related to the best - or even proper or appropriate - boundary conditions (BCs) that should be (or could be) applied to the lsquointermediatersquo velocity when the viscous terms in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are treated with an implicit time integration method and a Poisson equation is solved as part of a lsquotime steprsquo. These issues also pervade all related methods that uncouple the equations by lsquosplittingrsquo the pressure computation from that of the velocity - at least in the presence of solid boundaries and (again) when implicit treatment of the viscous terms is employed. This paper is intended to clarify these issues by showing which intermediate BCs are lsquobestrsquo and why some that are not work well anyway. In particular we show that all intermediate BCs must cause problems related to the regularity of the solution near boundaries, but that a near-miraculous recovery occurs such that accurate results are nevertheless achieved beyond the spurious boundary layer introduced by such methods. The mechanism for this lsquomiraclersquo is related to the existence of a higher-order equation that is actually satisfied by the pressure. All that is required then for projection (splitting, fractional step, etc.) methods to work well is that the spurious boundary layer be thin - as has been largely observed in practice.},

The nonlinear system under consideration is purely hyperbolic and contains a source term, the one for the evolution of the electric field, that becomes stiff for low values of the resistivity. For the spatial discretization we propose to use high order PN PM schemes as introduced in Dumbser et al. [M. Dumbser, D. Balsara, E.F. Toro, C.D. Munz, A unified framework for the construction of one-step finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes, Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2008) 8209-8253] for hyperbolic conservation laws and a high order accurate unsplit time-discretization is achieved using the element-local space-time discontinuous Galerkin approach proposed in Dumbser et al. [M. Dumbser, C. Enaux, E.F. Toro, Finite volume schemes of very high order of accuracy for stiff hyperbolic balance laws, Journal of Computational Physics 227 (2008) 3971-4001] for one-dimensional balance laws with stiff source terms. The divergence-free character of the magnetic field is accounted for through the divergence cleaning procedure of Dedner et al. [A. Dedner, F. Kemm, D. Kr??ner, C.-D. Munz, T. Schnitzer, M. Wesenberg, Hyperbolic divergence cleaning for the MHD equations, Journal of Computational Physics 175 (2002) 645-673]. To validate our high order method we first solve some numerical test cases for which exact analytical reference solutions are known and we also show numerical convergence studies in the stiff limit of the RRMHD equations using PN PM schemes from third to fifth order of accuracy in space and time. We also present some applications with shock waves such as a classical shock tube problem with different values for the conductivity as well as a relativistic MHD rotor problem and the relativistic equivalent of the Orszag-Tang vortex problem. We have verified that the proposed method can handle equally well the resistive regime and the stiff limit of ideal relativistic MHD. For these reasons it provides a powerful tool for relativistic astrophysical simulations involving the appearance of magnetic reconnection. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A uniqueness theorem is proved subject to condition (E), which is equivalent to Lax's shock inequalities when the system is "genuinely nonlinear." These general observations are then applied to the equations of gas dynamics without the convexity condition Pvv(v, s) {\textgreater} 0. Using condition (E), we prove the uniqueness theorem for the Riemann problem of the gas dynamics equations. This answers a question of Bethe. Next, we establish the relation between the shock speed [sigma] and the entropy S along any shock curve. That the entropy S increases across any shock, first proved by Weyl for the convex case, is established for the nonconvex case by a different method. Wendroff also considered the gas dynamics equations without convexity conditions and constructed a solution to the Riemann problem. Notice that his solution does satisfy our condition (E).},

A slight fluid compressibility is assumed that allows to relate the mechanical pressure to the local volume variation. The method described features a global pressure condensation which in turn enables the definition of a purely displacement-based linear system of equations. A matrix-free technique is used for the solution of such linear system, leading to an efficient implementation.

abstract = {In this paper we propose a new high order accurate centered path-conservative method on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes for the solution of multi-dimensional non-conservative hyperbolic systems, as they typically arise in the context of compressible multi-phase flows. Our path-conservative centered scheme is an extension of the centered method recently proposed in [40] for conservation laws, to which it reduces if the system matrix is the Jacobian of a flux function. The main advantage in the proposed centered approach compared to upwind methods is that no information about the eigenstructure of the system or Roe averages are needed. The final fully discrete high order accurate formulation in space and time is obtained using the general framework of PN PM schemes proposed in [16], which unifies in one single general family of schemes classical finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods. These PN PM methods can also be called reconstructed discontinuous Galerkin schemes, due to the use of the PN PM least-squares reconstruction operator. We show applications of our high order accurate unstructured centered method to the two- and three-dimensional Baer-Nunziato equations of compressible multiphase flows as introduced in [4]. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The computation of detonation waves in heterogeneous explosives involves compressible multiphase mixtures due to the chemical decomposition of the energetic material as well as its heterogeneous initial formulation. Also material interfaces are present between the explosive and the surrounding inert or reactive materials. We develop a new method for the modelling of interface problems and multiphase mixtures in the particular limit where phases pressures and velocities relax towards equilibrium very fast. This method is a variant of the discrete equations for multiphase mixtures proposed by Abgrall and Saurel [J. Comput. Phys. 186 (2) (2003) 361]. The new discrete model is adapted to reacting flows with mass, momentum and energy transfer. The model is based on the pure material equation of state only (no mixture equation of state is used) for the computation of the reaction zone of detonation waves. The algorithm is full Eulerian and fulfills interface conditions between mixtures and pure materials automatically. It is validated over a set of difficult test problems with exact solution and its multi-dimensional capabilities are shown over problems involving a large number of materials. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {THE problem of the uniform and infinitely slow motion of a sphere, or cylinder, through an unlimited mass of incompressible viscous liquid otherwise at rest was fully treated by Stokes in his celebrated memoir on Pendulums. The two cases mentioned stand in sharp contrast. In the first a relative steady motion of the fluid is easily determined, satisfying all the conditions both at the surface of the sphere and at infinity; and the force required to propel the sphere is found to be finite, being given by the formula (126) -F = 6PiuaV ....... (1) where u is the viscosity, a the radius, and V the velocity of the sphere. On the other hand in tile case of the cylinder, moving transversely, no such steady motion is possible. If we suppose the cylinder originally at rest to be started and afterwards maintained in uniform motion, finite effects are propagated to ever greater and greater distances, and the motion of the fluid approaches no limit. Stokes shows that more and more of the fluid tends to accompany the travelling cylinder, which thus experiences a continually decreasing resistance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a Runge-Kutta (RK) central discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) gas-kinetic BGK method for the Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed method is based on the CDG method defined on two sets of overlapping meshes to avoid discontinuous solutions at cell interfaces, as well as the gas-kinetic BGK model to evaluate fluxes for both convection and diffusion terms. Redundant representation of the numerical solution in the CDG method offers great convenience in the design of gas-kinetic BGK fluxes. Specifically, the evaluation of fluxes at cell interfaces of one set of computational mesh is right inside the cells of the staggered mesh, hence the corresponding particle distribution function for flux evaluation is much simpler than that in existing gas-kinetic BGK methods. As a central scheme, the proposed CDG-BGK has doubled the memory requirement as the corresponding DG scheme; on the other hand, for the convection part, the CFL time step constraint of the CDG method for numerical stability is relatively large compared with that for the DG method. Numerical boundary conditions have to be treated with special care. Numerical examples for 1D and 2D viscous flow simulations are presented to validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed RK CDG-BGK method. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Thermal decomposition of energetic materials is accompanied by generation of heat, and under certain conditions may lead to the well-known phenomenon of the self-ignition (or thermal explosion). Therefore, it is of great concern of explosive community to predict whether or not a specimen of energetic material will ignite or not under given conditions (defined primarily by a specimen mass and shape, surrounding temperature, etc.). In order to describe the reactive heat conduction phenomena in an infinite slab, cylindrical, and spherical geometry of an explosive material, an own computer program, based on the thermal explosion theory and the finite difference method, was developed. The program was tested by the comparison of calculated times to ignition for some standard high explosives with times to ignition determined experimentally, as well as with times to ignitions calculated by some other authors. The results of calculations were also compared with the results of calculation according to an analytical solution of the heat balance equation derived by Frank-Kamenetskii. It was found out that not only values of the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, but also the kinetic model of thermal decomposition used in the calculation, have a crucial influence on the results of calculation. It was also shown that the Frank-Kamenetskii equation gives considerably lower values of the times to ignition, and higher values of the critical temperatures for explosives studied.},

@article{Kapila2002,
abstract = {Emergence of a detonation in a homogeneous, exothermically reacting medium can be deemed to occur in two phases. The first phase processes the medium so as to create conditions ripe for the onset of detonation. The actual events leading up to preconditioning may vary from one experiment to the next, but typically, at the end of this stage the medium is hot and in a state of nonuni- formity. The second phase consists of the actual formation of the detonation wave via chemico-gasdynamic interactions. This paper considers an idealized medium with simple, rate-sensitive kinetics for which the preconditioned state is modelled as one with an initially prescribed linear gradient of temperature. Accurate and well-resolved numerical computations are carrried out to deter- mine the mode of detonation formation as a function of the size of the initial gradient. For shallow gradients, the result is a decelerating supersonic reaction wave, a weak detonation, whose trajectory is dictated by the initial temperature profile, with only weak intervention from hydrodynamics. If the domain is long enough, or the gradient less shallow, the wave slows down to the Chapman– Jouguet speed and undergoes a swift transition to the ZND structure. For sharp gradients, gasdynamic nonlinearity plays a much stronger role. Now the path to detonation is through an accelerating pulse that runs ahead of the reaction wave and rearranges the induction-time distribution there to one that bears lit- tle resemblance to that corresponding to the initial temperature gradient. The pulse amplifies and steepens, transforming itself into a complex consisting of a lead shock, an induction zone, and a following fast deflagration. As the pulse advances, its three constituent entities attain progressively higher levels of mutual coherence, to emerge as a ZND detonation. For initial gradients that are intermediate in size, aspects of both the extreme scenarios appear in the path to detonation. The novel aspect of this study resides in the fact that it is guided by, and its results are compared with, existing asymptotic analyses of detonation evolution.},

abstract = {We develop a new family of well-balanced path-conservative quadrature-free one-step ADER finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured meshes for the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations with non-conservative products and stiff source terms. The fully discrete formulation is derived using the recently developed framework of explicit one-step PN PM schemes of arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and time for conservative hyperbolic systems [Dumbser M, Balsara D, Toro EF, Munz CD. A unified framework for the construction of one-step finite-volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes. J Comput Phys 2008;227:8209-53]. The two key ingredients of our high order approach are: first, the high order accurate PN PM reconstruction operator on unstructured meshes, using the WENO strategy presented in [Dumbser M, K??ser M, Titarev VA Toro EF. Quadrature-free non-oscillatory finite volume schemes on unstructured meshes for nonlinear hyperbolic systems. J Comput Phys 2007;226:204-43] to ensure monotonicity at discontinuities, and second, a local space-time Galerkin scheme to predict the evolution of the reconstructed polynomial data inside each element during one time step to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization. This approach is also able to deal with stiff source terms as shown in [Dumbser M, Enaux C, Toro EF. Finite volume schemes of very high order of accuracy for stiff hyperbolic balance laws. J Comput Phys 2008;227:3971-4001]. These two key ingredients are combined with the recently developed path-conservative methods of Par??s [Par??s C.

A chemically-active flow governed by the reactive Euler equations, which has an exact solution, is used as a validation exercise. Various (previously loosely-connected) pieces of numerical and analytical work are brought together in lieu of a review, to set the scene for the multidimensional studies that follow. Two-dimensional flow is induced by a temperature perturbation $\Delta$T of order $\epsilon$ (the dimensionless inverse activation energy), in an otherwise planar flowfield. The effect of small variations in AT on the ignition pattern is investigated by means of a series of numerical integrations.

abstract = {An Eulerian conservative hyperbolic model of isotropic elastic materials subjected to finite deformation is addressed. It was developed by Godunov [S.K. Godunov, Elements of continuum mechanics, Nauka, Moscow, 1978 (in Russian) and G.H. Miller, P. Colella, A high-order Eulerian Godunov method for elastic-plastic flow in solids, J. Comput. Phys. 167 (2001) 131-176]. Some modifications are made concerning a more suitable form of governing equations. They form a set of evolution equations for a local cobasis which is naturally related to the Almansi deformation tensor. Another novelty is that the equation of state is given in terms of invariants of the Almansi tensor in a form which separates hydrodynamic and shear effects. This model is compared with another hyperbolic non-conservative model which is widely used in engineering sciences. For this model we develop a Riemann solver and determine some reference solutions which are compared with the conservative model. The numerical results for different tests show good agreement of both models for waves of very small and very large amplitude. However, for waves of intermediate amplitude important discrepancies between results are clearly visible. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this regard, the ghost fluid method has been successfully used to capture the interface conditions for bothfluid fluid and solid fluid interfaces. However, the ghost fluid method results in over/underheating errors when shocks impact interfaces, and hence must be supplemented with numerical corrective measures to mitigate these errors. Such corrections typically fail for strong shock applications. Variantsand extensions of the ghostfluidmethod have been proposed toremedy its shortcomings with mixed success. In this paper, the performance of approaches based on the ghost fluid method, in the case of strong shocks impinging on immersed solid boundaries in compressible flows, is evaluated. It is found that (from the viewpoint of simplicity, robustness, and accuracy) a reflective boundary condition used in conjunction with a local Riemann solver at the interface proves to be a good choice. The method is found to be stable, accurate, and robust for wide range problems involving strong shocks interacting with embedded solid objects.},

abstract = {A thermodynamically consistent and fully conservative (TCFC) treatment of contact discontinuities (designated as TCFC model in this paper) is proposed for the simulation of compressible multicomponent flows with shock-interface interactions, yielding an accurate capture of contact discontinuities. Starting from the total energy equation of the mixture, a new formulation is developed to define the ratio of specific heats of the mixture, and a governing equation in conservative form for the pressure is subsequently obtained. Another formulation is derived to determine the molecular weight of the mixture from classical thermodynamics. The governing equations in conservative form are further derived to calculate the specific heats ratio and the molecular weight of the mixture with their new formulations and the continuity or mass fraction equations for the individual components. Finally, the governing equations for the ratio of specific heats, the molecular weight and the pressure, combined with the continuity and momentum equations, offer the new hyperbolic conservation laws for the description of multicomponent or multifluid flows with shock-interface interactions. A simple version of the model is also developed without solving the governing equation for the molecular weight of the mixture. A brief analysis of the numerical uncertainties of conventional conservation models and the present TCFC models is presented and the consistency of any additional equation derived within any model with the initial governing equations is investigated. An analysis of the proposed TCFC model and the conventional conservative models is also performed on the pressure evolution for a mixture associated with isolated contact discontinuities. The results show that the present TCFC model produces a uniform pressure field and thus the pressure maintains in equilibrium across the material interfaces. The proposed TCFC model is then implemented into a Godunov-type method based upon a fast, exact Riemann solver. Several multicomponent flow problems with both strong and weak shocks are simulated using this new model and conventional conservation models, and comparisons of the numerical results from the various models and, where possible, exact solutions are performed. It is shown that the proposed TCFC model can handle both strong and weak shocks, and that the numerical solutions are completely oscillation-free through the contact discontinuities. This new approach offers a suitable treatment of contact discontinuities for compressible multicomponent flows and also maintains all the favorable features of fully conservative conservation laws. It belongs to the conservative approaches and is independent of numerical schemes. From the analysis of the numerical uncertainties of several models proposed in the past and the present numerical experiments, it is determined that the conservative or non-conservative form of some additional governing equations is not the ultimate reason that produces oscillating solutions near the material interfaces. The main cause of the oscillating solutions with conventional conservation models is the inappropriate determination of the ratio of specific heats of the mixture. Oscillation-free results are obtained for two test cases with weak shocks even with conventional conservation models using the present Godunov-type method based on a fast exact Riemann solver. This suggests that the problems with weak shocks and strong post-shock contact discontinuities are not suitable for the model validation in multicomponent flows. The capability of handling strong shocks and weak post-shock contact discontinuities is more critical to the demonstration of any model for compressible multicomponent or multifluid flows. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The process of planar detonation ignition, induced by a constant-velocity piston or equivalently by a shock reflected from a stationary wall, is investigated using high-resolution one-dimensional numerical simulations. The standard one-step model with Arrhenius kinetics, which models thermally sensitive explosives, is employed. Emphasis is on comparing and contrasting the results of the finite activation temperature simulations with high activation temperature asymptotic predictions and previous simulations. During the induction phase, it is shown that the asymptotic results give qualitatively good predictions. However, for parameters representative of gaseous explosives, subsequent to thermal runaway at the piston and the formation of a reaction wave, the high activation temperature asymptotic theory is qualitatively incorrect for moderately high activation temperatures. It is shown that the results are very sensitive to the value of the activation temperature, especially the distance from the piston at which a secondary shock forms and the degree of unsteadiness in the reaction wave which moves away from the piston. The dependence of the ignition evolution on the other parameters (initial shock Mach number, heat of reaction and polytropic index) is also investigated. It is shown that qualitative predictions regarding the dependence of the ignition evolution on each of the parameters can be elucidated from finite activation temperature homogeneous explosion calculations together with the high activation temperature asymptotic shock ignition results. It is found that for sufficiently strong initiating shocks the ignition evolution is qualitatively different from cases studied previously in that no secondary shock forms. For a high polytropic index, corresponding to a simple equation of state model for condensed phase explosives, the results are in much better qualitative agreement with the asymptotic theory.},

abstract = {Exact one-dimensional solutions to the equations of fluid dynamics are derived in the large-Pr and small-Pr limits (where Pr is the Prandtl number). The solutions are analogous to the Pr = 3/4 solution discovered by Becker and analytically capture the profile of shock fronts in ideal gases. The large-Pr solution is very similar to Becker's solution, differing only by a scale factor. The small-Pr solution is qualitatively different, with an embedded isothermal shock occurring above a critical Mach number. Solutions are derived for constant viscosity and conductivity as well as for the case in which conduction is provided by a radiation field. For a completely general density- and temperature-dependent viscosity and conductivity, the system of equations in all three limits can be reduced to quadrature. The maximum error in the analytical solutions when compared to a numerical integration of the finite-Pr equations is O(1/Pr) for large Pr and O(Pr) for small Pr.},

abstract = {The laser-induced ignition response of HMX has been investigated using a detailed numerical model. The model is one-dimensional, fully transient, and solves the conservation equations for both the condensed and gas phases. The condensed phase representation includes radiation absorption, solid-phase transitions, melting, evaporation, and distributed semi-global decomposition kinetics. The gas phase utilizes a detailed kinetic mechanism to predict species formation and destruction. Ignition occurs in the gas phase and the flame propagates back toward the surface of the HMX in what is known as the 'snap-back' effect. The model then transitions to steady-state combustion. Calculations were performed in which the solid HMX is irradiated with heat fluxes ranging from 50 to 1600W/cm2. Results are compared to empirical data for the laser-induced ignition of HMX. Good agreement with these data and other steady-state data (burning rate, surface temperature, melt thickness) provide the necessary validation of the developed model.},

abstract = {In this paper, we unify advection and diffusion into a single hyperbolic system by extending the first-order system approach introduced for the diffusion equation [J. Comput. Phys., 227 (2007) 315-352] to the advection-diffusion equation. Specifically, we construct a unified hyperbolic advection-diffusion system by expressing the diffusion term as a first-order hyperbolic system and simply adding the advection term to it. Naturally then, we develop upwind schemes for this entire system; there is thus no need to develop two different schemes, i.e., advection and diffusion schemes. We show that numerical schemes constructed in this way can be automatically uniformly accurate, allow O(h) time step, and compute the solution gradients (viscous stresses/heat fluxes for the Navier-Stokes equations) simultaneously to the same order of accuracy as the main variable, for all Reynolds numbers. We present numerical results for boundary-layer type problems on non-uniform grids in one dimension and irregular triangular grids in two dimensions to demonstrate various remarkable advantages of the proposed approach. In particular, we show that the schemes solving the first-order advection-diffusion system give a tremendous speed-up in CPU time over traditional scalar schemes despite the additional cost of carrying extra variables and solving equations for them. We conclude the paper with discussions on further developments to come. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Recent improvements to the code have aided the computational capability in modeling the behavior of energetic materials systems exposed to strong thermal environments such as fires. These models and computational techniques are applied to a thermal explosion expt. involving the slow heating of a confined explosive. The model includes the transition from slow heating to rapid deflagration in which the time scale decreases from days to hundreds of microseconds. Thermal, mech., and chem. effects are modeled during all phases of this process. The heating stage involves thermal expansion and decompn. according to an Arrhenius kinetics model while a pressure-dependent burn model is employed during the explosive phase. The numerical strategies employed to make the transition from slow to fast dynamics are described and demonstrated. In addn., the sensitivity is investigated of wall expansion rates to numerical strategies and parameters. Results from a one-dimensional model show that violence is affected by the presence of a gap between the explosive and container. In addn., a comparison is made between 2D model and measured results for the explosion temp. and tube wall expansion profiles. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new family of high order accurate Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) one-step ADER-WENO finite volume schemes for the solution of nonlinear systems of conservative and non-conservative hyperbolic partial differential equations with stiff source terms on moving tetrahedral meshes in three space dimensions. A WENO reconstruction technique is used to achieve high order of accuracy in space, while an element-local space-time Discontinuous Galerkin finite element predictor on moving curved meshes is used to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization. Within the space-time predictor the physical element is mapped onto a reference element using a high order isoparametric approach, where the space-time basis and test functions are given by the Lagrange interpolation polynomials passing through a predefined set of space-time nodes. Since our algorithm is cell-centered, the final mesh motion is computed by using a suitable node solver algorithm. A rezoning step as well as a flattener strategy are used in some of the test problems to avoid mesh tangling or excessive element deformations that may occur when the computation involves strong shocks or shear waves. The ALE algorithm presented in this article belongs to the so-called direct ALE methods because the final Lagrangian finite volume scheme is based directly on a space-time conservation formulation of the governing PDE system, with the rezoned geometry taken already into account during the computation of the fluxes.We apply our new high order unstructured ALE schemes to the 3D Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics, for which a set of classical numerical test problems has been solved and for which convergence rates up to sixth order of accuracy in space and time have been obtained. We furthermore consider the equations of classical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) as well as the non-conservative seven-equation Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows with stiff relaxation source terms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The objective is to design a software environment that will: facilitate computation in a variety of experiments in which strong shock waves impinge on targets comprising various combinations of materials; compute the target materials' subsequent dynamic response; and validate these computations against experimental data. Successfully constructing such a facility requires modeling of the highest accuracy. We must model at atomistic scales to correctly describe the material properties of the target materials and high explosives; at intermediate (meso) scales to understand the micromechanical response of the target materials; and at continuum scales to capture properly the evolution of macroscopic effects. The article outlines such a test facility. Although it is a very simplified version of the facilities found in a shock-compression laboratory, our VTF includes all the basic features, offering a problem solving environment for validating experiments and facilitating further development of simulation capabilities.},

abstract = {This paper reviews some of the recent developments in upstream difference schemes through a unified representation, in order to enable comparison between the various schemes. Special attention is given to the Godunov-type schemes that result from using an approximate solution of the Riemann problem. For schemes based on flux splitting, the approximate Riemann solution can be interpreted as a solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation. Introduction. Upstream-differencing schemes attempt to discretize hyperbolic par-tial differential equations by using differences biased in the direction determined by the sign of the characteristic speed. In recent years upstream differencing has become very popular, and a multitude of new techniques of implementing directionally biased differencing have been suggested. This popularity is primarily due to the robustness of upstream-differencing schemes, the availability of an underlying physical model, and the possibility of achieving high resolution of stationary discontinuities. Most of these schemes are an extension of the Courant-Isaacson-Rees scheme [1] to nonlinear conservation laws, and therefore a unified description may be given. The present paper concentrates on reviewing basic concepts and deriving design principles; numerical experimentation is not presented. The paper is built up as follows. Section 1 reviews some properties of the equations essential to their proper numerical approximation. In ?2 we discuss a straightforward extension of linear upstream differenc-ing to nonlinear systems. Section 3 introduces the physical picture due to Godunov, useful to interpret certain schemes from ?2 and to construct new schemes. Finally, in ?4 we comment on flux splitting, another form of upstream differencing, and relate it to a class of schemes motivated by the Boltzmann equation. 1. Weak solutions and their numerical approximation. In this paper we consider numerical solutions of the initial-value problem for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws},

abstract = {While Eulerian schemes work well for most gas flows, they have been shown to admit nonphysical oscillations near some material interfaces. In contrast, Lagrangian schemes work well at multimaterial interfaces, but suffer from their own difficulties in problems with large deformations and vorticity characteristic of most gas flows. We believe that the most robust schemes will combine the best properties of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for treating interfaces in Eulerian schemes that maintains a Heaviside profile of the density with no numerical smearing along the lines of earlier work and most Lagrangian schemes. We use a level set function to track the motion of a multimaterial interface in an Eulerian framework. In addition, the use of ghost cells (actually ghost nodes in our finite difference framework) and a new isobaric fix technique allows us to keep the density profile from smearing out, while still keeping the scheme robust and easy to program with simple extensions to multidimensions and multilevel time integration, e.g., Runge–Kutta methods. In contrast, previous methods used ill-advised dimensional splitting for multidimensional problems and suffered from great complexity when used in conjunction with multilevel time integrators.},

abstract = {Insensitive munitions design against thermal stimuli like slow or fast cook-off has become a significant requirement for today's munitions. In order to achieve insensitive munitions characteristics, the response of the energetic material needs to be predicted against heating stimuli. In this study, a 2D numerical code was developed to simulate the slow and fast cook-off heating conditions of confined munitions and to obtain the response of the energetic materials. Computations were performed in order to predict the transient temperature distribution, the ignition time, and the location of ignition in the munitions. These predictions enable the designers to have an idea of when and at which location the energetic material ignites under certain adverse surrounding conditions. In the paper, the development of the code is explained and the numerical results are compared with available experimental and numerical data in the literature. Additionally, a parametric study was performed showing the effect of dimensional scaling of munitions and the heating rate on the ignition characteristics. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Gomez2007,
abstract = {A number of contributions have been made during the last decades to model pure-diffusive transport problems by using the so-called hyperbolic diffusion equations [M. Zakari, D. Jou, Equations of state and transport equations in viscous cosmological models, Phys. Rev. D 48 (1993) 1597-1601; T. Ruggeri, A. Muracchini, L. Seccia, Shock waves and second sound in a rigid heat conductor: a critical temperature for NaF and Bi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64 (1990) 2640-2643]. These equations are used for both mass and heat transport. The hyperbolic diffusion equations are obtained by substituting the classic time-independent constitutive equation (Fick's [A. Fick, Uber diffusion, Poggendorff's Annal. Phys. Chem. 94 (1855) 59-86] and Fourier's [J.B. Fourier, Th??orie analytique de la chaleur, Jacques Gabay, 1822] law, respectively) by a more general time-dependent equation, due to Cattaneo [M.C. Cattaneo, Sur une forme de l'equation de la chaleur liminant le paradoxe d'une propagation instantane, Comptes Rendus de L'Academie des Sciences: Series I-Mathematics 247 (1958) 431-433]. In some applications the use of a parabolic model for diffusive processes is accurate enough in spite of predicting an infinite speed of propagation (Cattaneo, 1958). However, the use of a wave-like equation that predicts a finite velocity of propagation is necessary in many other calculations [A. Compte, The generalized Cattaneo equation for the description of anomalous transport processes, J. Phys. A: Math. General 30 (1997) 7277-7289]. The studies of heat or mass transport with finite velocity of propagation have been limited, so far, to pure-diffusive situations. This paper proposes a formulation for convection-diffusion problems based on a Cattaneo-type law. The finite element solution of the proposed equations is addressed. The performance of the algorithm is verified by solving some 2D test cases. Some interesting features of the proposed model can be observed from these examples and we conclude that the proposal is a feasible alternative to the parabolic model for real engineering simulations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The fluid is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The space-time finite element method is applied to both continua leading to an almost uniform discretization in which velocity variables are used for fluid and structure. In order to enforce momentum conservation and geometric continuity at the interface, a weighted residual formulation of coupling conditions is introduced. The discretized model equations for fluid, structure and coupling conditions are formulated in a single equation system. The nonlinear system and the fluid mesh movement are solved in a single iteration loop. Two-dimensional examples of membrane flutter and vortex excited plate vibrations demonstrate the efficiency of the methodology. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We propose a simple extension of the well-known Riemann solver of Osher and Solomon (Math. Comput. 38:339–374, 1982) to a certain class of hyperbolic systems in non-conservative form, in particular to shallow-water-type and multi-phase flow models. To this end we apply the formalism of path-conservative schemes introduced by Par{\'{e}}s (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 44:300–321, 2006) and Castro et al. (Math. Comput. 75:1103–1134, 2006). For the sake of generality and simplicity, we suggest to compute the inherent path integral numerically using a Gaussian quadrature rule of sufficient accuracy. Published pathconservative schemes to date are based on either the Roe upwind method or on centered approaches. In comparison to these, the proposed new path-conservative Osher-type scheme has several advantages. First, it does not need an entropy fix, in contrast to Roe-type pathconservative schemes. Second, our proposed non-conservative Osher scheme is very simple to implement and nonetheless constitutes a complete Riemann solver in the sense that it attributes a different numerical viscosity to each characteristic field present in the relevant Riemann problem; this is in contrast to centered methods or incomplete Riemann solvers that usually neglect intermediate characteristic fields, hence leading to excessive numerical diffusion. Finally, the interface jump term is differentiable with respect to its arguments, which is useful for steady-state computations in implicit schemes. We also indicate how to extend the method to general unstructured meshes in multiple space dimensions. We show applications of the first order version of the proposed path-conservative Osher-type scheme to the shallow water equations with variable bottom topography and to the two-fluid debris flow model of Pitman {\&} Le. Then, we apply the higher-order multi-dimensional version of the method to the Baer–Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flow. We also clearly emphasize the limitations of our approach in a special chapter at the end of this article.},
