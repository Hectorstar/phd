@article{Jackson2017a,
abstract = {A new second-order numerical scheme based on an operator splitting is proposed for the Godunov–Peshkov–Romenski model of continuum mechanics. The homogeneous part of the system is solved with a finite volume method based on a WENO reconstruction, and the temporal ODEs are solved using some analytic results presented here. Whilst it is not possible to attain arbitrary-order accuracy with this scheme (as with ADER-WENO schemes used previously), the attainable order of accuracy is often sufficient, and solutions are computationally cheap when compared with other available schemes. The new scheme is compared with an ADER-WENO scheme for various test cases, and a convergence study is undertaken to demonstrate its order of accuracy.},

@article{Jackson2017b,
abstract = {Hyperbolic systems of PDEs can be solved to arbitrary orders of accuracy by using the ADER Finite Volume method. These PDE systems may be non-conservative and non-homogeneous, and contain stiff source terms. ADER-FV requires a spatio-temporal polynomial reconstruction of the data in each spacetime cell, at each time step. This reconstruction is obtained as the root of a nonlinear system, resulting from the use of a Galerkin method. It was proved in Jackson [7] that for traditional choices of basis polynomials, the eigenvalues of certain matrices appearing in these nonlinear systems are always 0, regardless of the number of spatial dimensions of the PDEs or the chosen order of accuracy of the ADER-FV method. This guarantees fast convergence to the Galerkin root for certain classes of PDEs. In Montecinos and Balsara [9] a new, more efficient class of basis polynomials for the one-dimensional ADER-FV method was presented. This new class of basis polynomials, originally presented for conservative systems, is extended to multidimensional, non-conservative systems here, and the corresponding property regarding the eigenvalues of the Galerkin matrices is proved.},
