abstract = {In this article we extend the high order ADER finite volume schemes introduced for stiff hyperbolic balance laws by Dumbser, Enaux and Toro (J. Comput. Phys. 227:3971–4001, 2008) to nonlinear systems of advection–diffusion–reaction equations with stiff algebraic source terms. We derive a new efficient formulation of the local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor using a nodal approach whose interpolation points are tensor-products of Gauss–Legendre quadrature points. Furthermore, we propose a new simple and efficient strategy to compute the initial guess of the locally implicit space-time DG scheme: the Gauss–Legendre points are initialized sequentially in time by a second order accurate MUSCL-type approach for the flux term combined with a Crank–Nicholson method for the stiff source terms. We provide numerical evidence that when starting with this initial guess, the final iterative scheme for the solution of the nonlinear algebraic equations of the local space-time DG predictor method becomes more efficient. We apply our new numerical method to some systems of advection–diffusion–reaction equations with particular emphasis on the asymptotic preserving property for linear model systems and the compressible Navier–Stokes equations with chemical reactions.},

abstract = {This work presents a spatially and temporally second-order cell-centered Lagrangian formulation (CCH) suitable for elasto-plastic materials on unstructured polyhedral cells in multiple dimensions. In the development of our scheme, we follow a mimetic approach, based upon the finite volume method, as a guide to the derivation of the difference equations. In doing so, we consider not only the governing equations, but a number of ancillary relationships. The finite volume equations for solids are cast in Lagrangian form with particular attention to the discrete form of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We expand upon previous work and propose a new entropy production expression. A new tensor dissipation model is presented that guarantees the viscous stress tensor is symmetric. The new tensor dissipation model shows increased mesh robustness. In the second-order formulation, a limiter for the stress gradient is presented, as well as a vorticity limiter for the velocity gradient. Numerical results are demonstrated for common test problems involving both gas and solid constitutive models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A very common problem in science is the numerical diagonalization of symmetric or hermitian 3x3 matrices. Since standard "black box" packages may be too inefficient if the number of matrices is large, we study several alternatives. We consider optimized implementations of the Jacobi, QL, and Cuppen algorithms and compare them with an analytical method relying on Cardano's formula for the eigenvalues and on vector cross products for the eigenvectors. Jacobi is the most accurate, but also the slowest method, while QL and Cuppen are good general purpose algorithms. The analytical algorithm outperforms the others by more than a factor of 2, but becomes inaccurate or may even fail completely if the matrix entries differ greatly in magnitude. This can mostly be circumvented by using a hybrid method, which falls back to QL if conditions are such that the analytical calculation might become too inaccurate. For all algorithms, we give an overview of the underlying mathematical ideas, and present detailed benchmark results.

abstract = {An Eulerian, multi-material numerical method is described for computing dynamic problems involving large deformations in elastic-plastic solids. This approach addresses algorithm failures associated with reconnection and change in topology observed in previously proposed formulations. Among the information contained in the deformation gradients commonly employed for defining constitutive laws suitable for solids, only the symmetric matrix tensor obtained from a polar decomposition of the elastic component of the deformation is required to determine the stress state. The numerical utilization of this symmetric tensor, associated with material stretch, eliminates undesirable, discontinuous deformation states produced by local rigid-body rotations at same-material reconnecting interfaces. Such states appear even where stress states in impacting regions are similar. The temporal evolution of the stretches neither modifies the eigenstructure of the system of equations nor changes its size. We also present a new multi-material approximate Riemann solver based on the HLLD approach, previously applied to other hyperbolic systems, in which waves of distinct velocity exist, for example, as in magnetohydrodynamics. This solver is employed in combination with the modified ghost fluid method (M-GFM) in the description of multi-material interfaces. These composite algorithms enable numerical simulations of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (i.e., the instability produced by the interaction of an interface separating materials of different density with a shock wave at an angle) in converging geometries for solid materials that would have previously led to the failure of the method. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Dumbser2008a,
abstract = {In this article, we propose a new class of finite volume schemes of arbitrary accuracy in space and time for systems of hyperbolic balance laws with stiff source terms. The new class of schemes is based on a three stage procedure. First a high-order WENO reconstruction procedure is applied to the cell averages at the current time level. Second, the temporal evolution of the reconstruction polynomials is computed locally inside each cell using the governing equations. In the original ENO scheme of Harten et al. and in the ADER schemes of Titarev and Toro, this time evolution is achieved via a Taylor series expansion where the time derivatives are computed by repeated differentiation of the governing PDE with respect to space and time, i.e. by applying the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure. However, this approach is not able to handle stiff source terms. Therefore, we present a new strategy that only replaces the Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure compared to the previously mentioned schemes. For the time-evolution part of the algorithm, we introduce a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element scheme that is able to handle also stiff source terms. This step is the only part of the algorithm which is locally implicit. The third and last step of the proposed ADER finite volume schemes consists of the standard explicit space-time integration over each control volume, using the local space-time DG solutions at the Gaussian integration points for the intercell fluxes and for the space-time integral over the source term. We will show numerical convergence studies for nonlinear systems in one space dimension with both non-stiff and with very stiff source terms up to sixth order of accuracy in space and time. The application of the new method to a large set of different test cases is shown, in particular the stiff scalar model problem of LeVeque and Yee [R.J. LeVeque, H.C. Yee, A study of numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws with stiff source terms, Journal of Computational Physics 86 (1) (1990) 187-210], the relaxation system of Jin and Xin [S. Jin, Z.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new unified family of arbitrary high order accurate explicit one-step finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes for the solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. This new family of numerical methods has first been proposed in [16] for purely hyperbolic systems and has been called PNPMschemes, where N indicates the polynomial degree of the test functions and M is the degree of the polynomials used for flux and source computation. A particular feature of the general PNPMschemes is that they contain classical high order accurate finite volume schemes (N = 0) as well as standard discontinuous Galerkin methods (M = N) just as special cases, which therefore allows for a direct efficiency comparison. In the application section of this paper we first show numerical convergence results on unstructured meshes obtained for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with Sutherland's viscosity law, comparing all third to sixth order accurate PNPMschemes with each other. In order to validate the method also in practice we show several classical steady and unsteady CFD applications, such as the laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate at high Reynolds numbers, flow past a NACA0012 airfoil, the unsteady flows past a circular cylinder and a sphere, the unsteady flows of a compressible mixing layer in two space dimensions and finally we also show applications to supersonic flows with shock Mach numbers up to Ms= 10. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model comprises a system of thermodynamically compatible balance laws based upon hyperelastic-inelastic theory: the mechanical conservation laws are supplemented by kinematic evolution equations for material deformation gradients, which can be written in conservative form. The formulation is rotationally invariant and hyperbolic, with a determinable characteristic structure. An operator split approach is proposed for integrating the governing constitutive models for three-dimensional Cauchy problems, in conjunction with a ghost material numerical method to resolve internal Dirichlet boundaries. Such methods naturally allow the generation of new internal boundaries making them ideal for simulating fragmenting materials and macroscale fracture. A remarkable feature of the proposed approach is that the overall complexity compares favourably with that of the model for elastoplastic deformations only. The simulation of expanding ring and flyer plate experiments are chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a cell-centered Lagrangian scheme devoted to the numerical simulation of solid dynamics on two-dimensional unstructured grids in planar geometry. This numerical method, utilizes the classical elastic-perfectly plastic material model initially proposed by Wilkins [M.L. Wilkins, Calculation of elastic-plastic flow, Meth. Comput. Phys. (1964)]. In this model, the Cauchy stress tensor is decomposed into the sum of its deviatoric part and the thermodynamic pressure which is defined by means of an equation of state. Regarding the deviatoric stress, its time evolution is governed by a classical constitutive law for isotropic material. The plasticity model employs the von Mises yield criterion and is implemented by means of the radial return algorithm. The numerical scheme relies on a finite volume cell-centered method wherein numerical fluxes are expressed in terms of sub-cell force. The generic form of the sub-cell force is obtained by requiring the scheme to satisfy a semi-discrete dissipation inequality. Sub-cell force and nodal velocity to move the grid are computed consistently with cell volume variation by means of a node-centered solver, which results from total energy conservation. The nominally second-order extension is achieved by developing a two-dimensional extension in the Lagrangian framework of the Generalized Riemann Problem methodology, introduced by Ben-Artzi and Falcovitz [M. Ben-Artzi, J. Falcovitz, Generalized Riemann Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics, Cambridge Monogr. Appl. Comput. Math. (2003)]. Finally, the robustness and the accuracy of the numerical scheme are assessed through the computation of several test cases. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The JWL EOS is of the Mie-Gr¨ uneisen form with a constant Gr¨ uneisen coefficient and a constants specific heat. It is thermodynamically consistent to specify the temperature at a reference state. However, increasing the refer- ence state temperature restricts the EOS domain in the (V, e)-plane of phase space. The restrictions are due to the conditions that P ≥ 0, T ≥ 0, and the isothermal bulk modulus is positive. Typically, this limits the low temperature regime in expansion. The domain restric- tions can result in the P-T equilibrium EOS of a partly burned HE failing to have a solution in some cases. For application to HE, the heat of detonation is discussed. Example JWL parameters for an HE, both products and reactions, are used to illustrate the restrictions on the domain of the EOS.},

abstract = {We discuss a unified flow theory which in a single system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) can describe the two main branches of continuum mechanics, fluid dynamics, and solid dynamics. The fundamental difference from the classical continuum models, such as the Navier-Stokes for example, is that the finite length scale of the continuum particles is not ignored but kept in the model in order to semi-explicitly describe the essence of any flows, that is the process of continuum particles rearrangements. To allow the continuum particle rearrangements, we admit the deformability of particle which is described by the distortion field. The ability of media to flow is characterized by the strain dissipation time which is a characteristic time necessary for a continuum particle to rearrange with one of its neighboring particles. It is shown that the continuum particle length scale is intimately connected with the dissipation time. The governing equations are represented by a system of first order hyperbolic PDEs with source terms modeling the dissipation due to particle rearrangements. Numerical examples justifying the reliability of the proposed approach are demonstrated.},

abstract = {We discuss a pure hyperbolic alternative to the Navier–Stokes equations, which are of parabolic type. As a result of the substitution of the concept of the viscosity coefficient by a microphysics-based temporal characteristic, particle settled life (PSL) time, it becomes possible to formulate a model for viscous fluids in a form of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations. Moreover, the concept of PSL time allows the use of the same model for flows of viscous fluids (Newtonian or non-Newtonian) as well as irreversible deformation of solids. In the theory presented, a continuum is interpreted as a system of material particles connected by bonds; the internal resistance to flow is interpreted as elastic stretching of the particle bonds; and a flow is a result of bond destructions and rearrangements of particles. Finally, we examine the model for simple shear flows, arbitrary incompressible and compressible flows of Newtonian fluids and demonstrate that Newton's viscous law can be obtained in the framework of the developed hyperbolic theory as a steady-state limit. A basic relation between the viscosity coefficient, PSL time, and the shear sound velocity is also obtained.},

abstract = {In this article we present a new formulation and an associated numerical algorithm, for the simulation of combustion and transition to detonation of condensed-phase commercial- and military-grade explosives, which are confined by (or in general interacting with one or more) compliant inert materials. Examples include confined rate-stick problems and interaction of shock waves with gas cavities or solid particles in explosives. This formulation is based on an augmented Euler approach to account for the mixture of the explosive and its products, and a multi-phase diffuse interface approach to solve for the immiscible interaction between the mixture and the inert materials, so it is in essence a hybrid (augmented Euler and multi-phase) model. As such, it has many of the desirable features of the two approaches and, critically for our applications of interest, it provides the accurate recovery of temperature fields across all components. Moreover, it conveys a lot more physical information than augmented Euler, without the complexity of full multi-phase Baer-Nunziato-type models or the lack of robustness of augmented Euler models in the presence of more than two components. The model can sustain large density differences across material interfaces without the presence of spurious oscillations in velocity and pressure, and it can accommodate realistic equations of state and arbitrary (pressure- or temperature-based) reaction-rate laws. Under certain conditions, we show that the formulation reduces to well-known augmented Euler or multi-phase models, which have been extensively validated and used in practice. The full hybrid model and its reduced forms are validated against problems with exact (or independently-verified numerical) solutions and evaluated for robustness for rate-stick and shock-induced cavity collapse case-studies.},

abstract = {The Riemann problem, and the associated generalized Riemann problem, are increasingly seen as the important building blocks for modern higher order Godunov-type schemes. In the past, building a generalized Riemann problem solver was seen as an intricately mathematical task for complicated physical or engineering problems because the associated Riemann problem is different for each hyperbolic system of interest. This paper changes that situation. The HLLI Riemann solver is a recently-proposed Riemann solver that is universal in that it is applicable to any hyperbolic system, whether in conservation form or with non-conservative products. The HLLI Riemann solver is also complete in the sense that if it is given a complete set of eigenvectors, it represents all waves with minimal dissipation. It is, therefore, very attractive to build a generalized Riemann problem solver version of the HLLI Riemann solver. This is the task that is accomplished in the present paper. We show that at second order, the generalized Riemann problem version of the HLLI Riemann solver is easy to design. Our GRP solver is also complete and universal because it inherits those good properties from original HLLI Riemann solver. We also show how our GRP solver can be adapted to the solution of hyperbolic systems with stiff source terms. Our generalized HLLI Riemann solver is easy to implement and performs robustly and well over a range of test problems. All implementation-related details are presented. Results from several stringent test problems are shown. These test problems are drawn from many different hyperbolic systems, and include hyperbolic systems in conservation form; with non-conservative products; and with stiff source terms. The present generalized Riemann problem solver performs well on all of them.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of the unified first order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics recently proposed by Peshkov and Romenski [110], further denoted as HPR model. In that framework, the viscous stresses are computed from the so-called distortion tensor A, which is one of the primary state variables in the proposed first order system. A very important key feature of the HPR model is its ability to describe at the same time the behavior of inviscid and viscous compressible Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with heat conduction, as well as the behavior of elastic and visco-plastic solids. Actually, the model treats viscous and inviscid fluids as generalized visco-plastic solids. This is achieved via a stiff source term that accounts for strain relaxation in the evolution equations of A. Also heat conduction is included via a first order hyperbolic system for the thermal impulse, from which the heat flux is computed. The governing PDE system is hyperbolic and fully consistent with the first and the second principle of thermodynamics. It is also fundamentally different from first order Maxwell-Cattaneo-type relaxation models based on extended irreversible thermodynamics. The HPR model represents therefore a novel and unified description of continuum mechanics, which applies at the same time to fluid mechanics and solid mechanics. In this paper, the direct connection between the HPR model and the classical hyperbolic-parabolic Navier-Stokes-Fourier theory is established for the first time via a formal asymptotic analysis in the stiff relaxation limit.From a numerical point of view, the governing partial differential equations are very challenging, since they form a large nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system that includes stiff source terms and non-conservative products. We apply the successful family of one-step ADER-WENO finite volume (FV) and ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes to the HPR model in the stiff relaxation limit, and compare the numerical results with exact or numerical reference solutions obtained for the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical convergence results are also provided. To show the universality of the HPR model, the paper is rounded-off with an application to wave propagation in elastic solids, for which one only needs to switch off the strain relaxation source term in the governing PDE system.We provide various examples showing that for the purpose of flow visualization, the distortion tensor A seems to be particularly useful.},

abstract = {Owing to the complex processes involved, faithful prediction of high-velocity impact events demands a simulation method delivering efficient calculations based on comprehensively formulated constitutive models. Such an approach is presented herein, employing a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method within an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations. Applied widely in computational fluid dynamics, these methods are well suited to the involved locally non-smooth finite deformations, circumventing any requirement for artificial viscosity functions for shock capturing. Application of the methods is facilitated through using a model of solid dynamics based upon hyper-elastic theory comprising kinematic evolution equations for the elastic distortion tensor. The model for finite inelastic deformations is phenomenologically equivalent to Maxwell's model of tangential stress relaxation. Closure relations tailored to the expected high-pressure states are proposed and calibrated for the materials of interest. Sharp interface resolution is achieved by employing level-set functions to track boundary motion, along with a ghost material method to capture the necessary internal boundary conditions for material interactions and stress-free surfaces. The approach is demonstrated for the simulation of high velocity impacts of steel projectiles on aluminium target plates in two and three dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

High order spatial accuracy is obtained through a WENO reconstruction, while a high order one-step time discretization is achieved using a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method. Due to the one-step nature of the underlying scheme, the resulting algorithm is particularly well suited for an AMR strategy on space-time adaptive meshes, i.e. with time-accurate local time stepping. The AMR property has been implemented 'cell-by-cell', with a standard tree-type algorithm, while the scheme has been parallelized via the message passing interface (MPI) paradigm. The new scheme has been tested over a wide range of examples for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, including the classical Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). High order in space and time have been confirmed via a numerical convergence study and a detailed analysis of the computational speed-up with respect to highly refined uniform meshes is also presented. We also show test problems where the presented high order AMR scheme behaves clearly better than traditional second order AMR methods.

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a cell-centered Lagrangian scheme devoted to the numerical simulation of solid dynamics on two-dimensional unstructured grids in planar geometry. This numerical method, utilizes the classical elastic-perfectly plastic material model initially proposed by Wilkins [M.L. Wilkins, Calculation of elastic-plastic flow, Meth. Comput. Phys. (1964)]. In this model, the Cauchy stress tensor is decomposed into the sum of its deviatoric part and the thermodynamic pressure which is defined by means of an equation of state. Regarding the deviatoric stress, its time evolution is governed by a classical constitutive law for isotropic material. The plasticity model employs the von Mises yield criterion and is implemented by means of the radial return algorithm. The numerical scheme relies on a finite volume cell-centered method wherein numerical fluxes are expressed in terms of sub-cell force. The generic form of the sub-cell force is obtained by requiring the scheme to satisfy a semi-discrete dissipation inequality. Sub-cell force and nodal velocity to move the grid are computed consistently with cell volume variation by means of a node-centered solver, which results from total energy conservation. The nominally second-order extension is achieved by developing a two-dimensional extension in the Lagrangian framework of the Generalized Riemann Problem methodology, introduced by Ben-Artzi and Falcovitz [M. Ben-Artzi, J. Falcovitz, Generalized Riemann Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics, Cambridge Monogr. Appl. Comput. Math. (2003)].

Schemes via the current approach are simple and economical: they solve the conservation laws in differential form and involve only one grid (not two grids that are staggered). In addition, they are conservative. As a result of the new approach, the DG scheme can be formulated using the differential instead of integral form.

Such corrections typically fail for strong shock applications. Variantsand extensions of the ghostfluidmethod have been proposed toremedy its shortcomings with mixed success. In this paper, the performance of approaches based on the ghost fluid method, in the case of strong shocks impinging on immersed solid boundaries in compressible flows, is evaluated.

abstract = {A simple interface-capturing approach proposed previously by the author for efficient numerical resolution of multicomponent problems with a van der Waals fluid [J. Comput. Phys., 156 (1999), pp. 43–88] is extended to a more general case with real materials characterized by a Mie–Gr{\"{u}}neisen equation of state. As before, the flow regime of interests is assumed to be homogeneous with no jumps in the pressure and velocity (the normal component of it) across the interfaces that separate two regions of different fluid components. The algorithm uses a mixture type of the model system that is formed by combining the Euler equations of gas dynamics for the basic conserved variables and an additional set of effective equations for the problem-dependent material quantities. In this approach, the latter equations are introduced in the algorithm primarily for an easy computation of the pressure from the equation of state, and are derived so as to ensure a consistent modeling of the energy equation near the interfaces where two or more fluid components are present in a grid cell, and also the fulfillment of the mass equation in the other single component regions. A standard high-resolution wave propagation method designed originally for single component flows is generalized to solve the proposed system for multicomponent flows, giving an efficient implementation of the algorithm. Several numerical results are presented in both one and two space dimensions that show the feasibility of the method with the Roe Riemann solver as applied to a reasonable class of practical problems without introducing any spurious oscillations in the pressure near the interfaces. This includes results obtained using a multicomponent version of the AMRCLAW software package of Berger and LeVeque for the simulation of the impact of an underwater aluminum plate to a copper plate in two space dimensions.},

First, we discuss some general conceptual differences between the two approaches. Second, a detailed study of both models is proposed, where differences are made evident at the aid of deriving a hypoelastic-type model corresponding to the hyperelastic model and a particular equation of state used in this paper. Third, using the same high order ADER Finite Volume and Discontinuous Galerkin methods on fixed and moving unstructured meshes for both models, a wide range of numerical benchmark test problems has been solved. The numerical solutions obtained for the two different models are directly compared with each other. For small elastic deformations, the two models produce very similar solutions that are close to each other. However, if large elastic or elastoplastic deformations occur, the solutions present larger differences.},

abstract = {We present a new version of conservative ADER-WENO finite volume schemes, in which both the high order spatial reconstruction as well as the time evolution of the reconstruction polynomials in the local space-time predictor stage are performed in primitive variables, rather than in conserved ones. To obtain a conservative method, the underlying finite volume scheme is still written in terms of the cell averages of the conserved quantities. Therefore, our new approach performs the spatial WENO reconstruction twice:the first WENO reconstruction is carried out on the known cell averages of the conservative variables. TheWENO polynomials are then used at the cell centers to compute point values of the conserved variables, which are subsequently converted into point values of the primitive variables. This is the only place where the conversion from conservative to primitive variables is needed in the new scheme. Then, a second WENO reconstruction is performed on the point values of the primitive variables to obtain piecewise high order reconstruction polynomials of the primitive variables. The reconstruction polynomials are subsequently evolved in time with a novel space-time finite element predictor that is directly applied to the governing PDE written in primitive form. The resulting space-time polynomials of the primitive variables can then be directly used as input for the numerical fluxes at the cell boundaries in the underlying conservative finite volume scheme. Hence, the number of necessary conversions fromthe conserved to the primitive variables is reduced to just one single conversion at each cell center.We have verified the validity of the new approach over a wide range of hyperbolic systems, including the classical Euler equations of gas dynamics, the special relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) and ideal magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) equations, as well as the Baer-Nunziato model for compressible two-phase flows. In all cases we have noticed that the new ADER schemes provide less oscillatory solutions when compared to ADER finite volume schemes based on the reconstruction in conserved variables, especially for the RMHD and the Baer-Nunziato equations. For the RHD and RMHD equations, the overall accuracy is improved and the CPU time is reduced by about 25{\%}. Because of its increased accuracy and due to the reduced computational cost, we recommend to use this version of ADER as the standard one in the relativistic framework. At the end of the paper, the new approach has also been extended to ADER-DG schemes on space-time adaptive grids (AMR).},

abstract = {In this paper a new, simple and universal formulation of the HLLEM Riemann solver (RS) is proposed that works for general conservative and non-conservative systems of hyperbolic equations. For non-conservative PDE, a path-conservative formulation of the HLLEM RS is presented for the first time in this paper. The HLLEM Riemann solver is built on top of a novel and very robust path-conservative HLL method. It thus naturally inherits the positivity properties and the entropy enforcement of the underlying HLL scheme. However, with just the slight additional cost of evaluating eigenvectors and eigenvalues of intermediate characteristic fields, we can represent linearly degenerate intermediate waves with a minimum of smearing.For conservative systems, our paper provides the easiest and most seamless path for taking a pre-existing HLL RS and quickly and effortlessly converting it to a RS that provides improved results, comparable with those of an HLLC, HLLD, Osher or Roe-type RS. This is done with minimal additional computational complexity, making our variant of the HLLEM RS also a very fast RS that can accurately represent linearly degenerate discontinuities. Our present HLLEM RS also transparently extends these advantages to non-conservative systems. For shallow water-type systems, the resulting method is proven to be well-balanced.Several test problems are presented for shallow water-type equations and two-phase flow models, as well as for gas dynamics with real equation of state, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD {\&} RMHD), and nonlinear elasticity.Since our new formulation accommodates multiple intermediate waves and has a broader applicability than the original HLLEM method, it could alternatively be called the HLLI Riemann solver, where the "I" stands for the intermediate characteristic fields that can be accounted for.},

abstract = {We propose a simple extension of the well-known Riemann solver of Osher and Solomon (Math. Comput. 38:339–374, 1982) to a certain class of hyperbolic systems in non-conservative form, in particular to shallow-water-type and multi-phase flow models. To this end we apply the formalism of path-conservative schemes introduced by Par{\'{e}}s (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 44:300–321, 2006) and Castro et al. (Math. Comput. 75:1103–1134, 2006). For the sake of generality and simplicity, we suggest to compute the inherent path integral numerically using a Gaussian quadrature rule of sufficient accuracy. Published pathconservative schemes to date are based on either the Roe upwind method or on centered approaches. In comparison to these, the proposed new path-conservative Osher-type scheme has several advantages. First, it does not need an entropy fix, in contrast to Roe-type pathconservative schemes. Second, our proposed non-conservative Osher scheme is very simple to implement and nonetheless constitutes a complete Riemann solver in the sense that it attributes a different numerical viscosity to each characteristic field present in the relevant Riemann problem; this is in contrast to centered methods or incomplete Riemann solvers that usually neglect intermediate characteristic fields, hence leading to excessive numerical diffusion. Finally, the interface jump term is differentiable with respect to its arguments, which is useful for steady-state computations in implicit schemes. We also indicate how to extend the method to general unstructured meshes in multiple space dimensions. We show applications of the first order version of the proposed path-conservative Osher-type scheme to the shallow water equations with variable bottom topography and to the two-fluid debris flow model of Pitman {\&} Le. Then, we apply the higher-order multi-dimensional version of the method to the Baer–Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flow. We also clearly emphasize the limitations of our approach in a special chapter at the end of this article.},

abstract = {Verification and validation (V{\&}V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V{\&}V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V{\&}V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V{\&}V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V{\&}V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors' contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed.

abstract = {This paper presents an arbitrary high-order accurate ADER Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method on space–time adaptive meshes (AMR) for the solution of two important families of non-linear time dependent partial differential equations for compressible dissipative flows : the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and the equations of viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics in two and three space-dimensions. The work continues a recent series of papers concerning the development and application of a proper a posteriori subcell finite volume limiting procedure suitable for discontinuous Galerkin methods (Dumbser et al., 2014, Zanotti et al., 2015 [40,41]). It is a well known fact that a major weakness of high order DG methods lies in the difficulty of limiting discontinuous solutions, which generate spurious oscillations, namely the so-called ‘Gibbs phenomenon'. In the present work, a nonlinear stabilization of the scheme is sequentially and locally introduced only for troubled cells on the basis of a novel a posteriori detection criterion, i.e. the MOOD approach. The main benefits of the MOOD paradigm, i.e. the computational robustness even in the presence of strong shocks, are preserved and the numerical diffusion is considerably reduced also for the limited cells by resorting to a proper sub-grid. In practice the method first produces a so-called candidate solution by using a high order accurate unlimited DG scheme. Then, a set of numerical and physical detection criteria is applied to the candidate solution, namely: positivity of pressure and density, absence of floating point errors and satisfaction of a discrete maximum principle in the sense of polynomials. Furthermore, in those cells where at least one of these criteria is violated the computed candidate solution is detected as troubled and is locally rejected. Subsequently, a more reliable numerical solution is recomputed a posteriori by employing a more robust but still very accurate ADER-WENO finite volume scheme on the subgrid averages within that troubled cell. Finally, a high order DG polynomial is reconstructed back from the evolved subcell averages. We apply the whole approach for the first time to the equations of compressible gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in the presence of viscosity, thermal conductivity and magnetic resistivity, therefore extending our family of adaptive ADER-DG schemes to cases for which the numerical fluxes also depend on the gradient of the state vector. The distinguished high-resolution properties of the presented numerical scheme standout against a wide number of non-trivial test cases both for the compressible Navier–Stokes and the viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations. The present results show clearly that the shock-capturing capability of the news schemes is significantly enhanced within a cell-by-cell Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) implementation together with time accurate local time stepping (LTS).},

abstract = {The Mie-Gr¨ uneisen equation of state (EOS) is frequently used in hy- dro simulations to model solids at high pressure (up to a few Mb). It is an incomplete EOS characterized by a Gr¨ uneisen coefficient, $\Gamma$ = −V (∂eP)V , that is a function of only V . Expressions are de- rived for isentropes and isotherms. This enables the extension to a complete EOS. Thermodynamic consistency requires that the specific heat is a function of a single scaled-temperature. A complete exten- sion is uniquely determined by the temperature dependence of the specific heat at a fixed reference density. In addition we show that if the domain of the EOS extends to T = 0 and the specific heat van- ishes on the zero isotherm then $\Gamma$ a function of only V is equivalent to a specific heat with a single temperature scale. If the EOS domain does not include the zero isotherm, then a specific heat with a single temperature scale leads to a generalization of the Mie-Gruneisen EOS in which the pressure is linear in both the specific energy and the tem- perature. This corresponds to the limiting case of two temperature scales with one of the scales in the high temperature limit. Such an EOS has previously been used to model liquid nitromethane.},

abstract = {A new method is presented for the explicit Eulerian finite difference computation of shock capturing problems involving multiple resolved material phases in three dimensions. We solve separately for each phase the equations of fluid dynamics or solid mechanics, using as interface boundary conditions artificially extended representations of the individual phases. For fluids we use a new 3D spatially unsplit implementation of the piecewise parabolic (PPM) method of Colella and Woodward. For solids we use the 3D spatially unsplit Eulerian solid mechanics method of Miller and Colella. Vacuum and perfectly incompressible obstacles may also be employed as phases. A separate problem is the time evolution of material interfaces, which are represented by planar segments constructed with a volume-of-fluid method. The volume fractions are advanced in time using a second-order 3D spatially unsplit advection routine with a velocity field determined by solution of interface-normal two-phase Riemann problems. From the Riemann problem solutions we also determine cross-interface momentum and energy fluxes. The volume fractions in mixed cells may be arbitrarily small, which would ordinarily make the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy time step stability limit arbitrarily small as well. We overcome this limitation using the mass-redistribution formalism to conservatively redistribute generalized mass in the neighborhood of the split cells. We present an application of this method to an explosion contained in a metal can: a reactive fluid (approximating PBX 9404) is encased within an elastic-plastic solid (approximating copper) surrounded by vacuum. Our implementation is in parallel, and with adaptive mesh refinement.},

To simulate such problems in the Eulerian framework on a fixed Cartesian mesh, all interfaces (free surfaces as well as interacting material interfaces) are tracked as levelsets; to resolve shocks and interfaces, a quad-tree adaptive mesh is employed. Collisions between embedded objects are resolved using an efficient collision detection algorithm and appropriate ineterfacial conditions are supplied. This paper addresses issues associated with the treatment of all interfaces as sharp entities by defining ghost fields on each side of the interface. Key issues of supplying interfacial conditions at the location of the interface and populating the ghost cells with physically consistent values during and beyond fragmentation events are addressed. An efficient parallel algorithm is used to handle computationally intensive three-dimensional problems. Numerous examples pertaining to impact, penetration, void collapse and fragmentation phenomena are presented along with careful benchmarking to establish the validity, the accuracy and the versatility of the approach.},

The required reconstruction of mixed cell volume fractions and cut cell geometries is presented in detail using the level-set fields. High-order accuracy is achieved by incorporating the weighted-essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method and Runge-Kutta time integration.

abstract = {The present paper introduces a class of finite volume schemes of increasing order of accuracy in space and time for hyperbolic systems that are in conservation form. The methods are specially suited for efficient implementation on structured meshes. The hyperbolic system is required to be non-stiff. This paper specifically focuses on Euler system that is used for modeling the flow of neutral fluids and the divergence-free, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system that is used for large scale modeling of ionized plasmas. Efficient techniques for weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) interpolation have been developed for finite volume reconstruction on structured meshes. We have shown that the most elegant and compact formulation of WENO reconstruction obtains when the interpolating functions are expressed in modal space. Explicit formulae have been provided for schemes having up to fourth order of spatial accuracy. Divergence-free evolution of magnetic fields requires the magnetic field components and their moments to be defined in the zone faces. We draw on a reconstruction strategy developed recently by the first author to show that a high order specification of the magnetic field components in zone-faces naturally furnishes an appropriately high order representation of the magnetic field within the zone. We also present a new formulation of the ADER (for Arbitrary Derivative Riemann Problem) schemes that relies on a local continuous space-time Galerkin formulation instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure. We call such schemes ADER-CG and show that a very elegant and compact formulation results when the scheme is formulated in modal space. Explicit formulae have been provided on structured meshes for ADER-CG schemes in three dimensions for all orders of accuracy that extend up to fourth order. Such ADER schemes have been used to temporally evolve the WENO-based spatial reconstruction. The resulting ADER-WENO schemes provide temporal accuracy that matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying WENO reconstruction. In this paper we have also provided a point-wise description of ADER-WENO schemes for divergence-free MHD in a fashion that facilitates computer implementation. The schemes reported here have all been implemented in the RIEMANN framework for computational astrophysics. All the methods presented have a one-step update, making them low-storage alternatives to the usual Runge-Kutta time-discretization. Their one-step update also makes them suitable building blocks for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) calculations. We demonstrate that the ADER-WENO meet their design accuracies. Several stringent test problems of Euler flows and MHD flows are presented in one, two and three dimensions. Many of our test problems involve near infinite shocks in multiple dimensions and the higher order schemes are shown to perform very robustly and accurately under all conditions. It is shown that the increasing computational complexity with increasing order is handily offset by the increased accuracy of the scheme. The resulting ADER-WENO schemes are, therefore, very worthy alternatives to the standard second order schemes for compressible Euler and MHD flow. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ADER schemes are numerical methods, which can reach an arbitrary order of accuracy in both space and time. They are based on a reconstruction procedure and the solution of generalized Riemann problems. However, for general boundary conditions, in particular of Dirichlet type, a lack of accuracy might occur if a suitable treatment of boundaries conditions is not properly carried out. In this work the treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions for conservation laws in the context of ADER schemes, is concerned. The solution of generalized Riemann problems at the extremes of the computational domain provides the correct influence of boundaries. The reconstruction procedure, for data near to the boundaries, demands information outside the computational domain, which is carried out in terms of ghost cells, which are provided by using the numerical solution of auxiliary problems. These auxiliary problems are hyperbolic and they are constructed from the conservation laws and the information at boundaries, which may be partially or totally known in terms of prescribed functions. The evolution of these problems, unlike the usual manner, is done in space rather than in time due to that these problems are named here, reverse problems. The methodology can be considered as a numerical counterpart of the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for filling ghost cells. However, the use of Taylor series expansions, as well as, Lax-Wendroff procedure, are avoided. For the scalar case is shown that the present procedure preserves the accuracy of the scheme which is reinforced with some numerical results. Expected orders of accuracy for solving conservation laws by using the proposed strategy at boundaries are obtained up to fifth-order in both space and time.},

We utilise Papanastasiou regularisation in our algorithm to deal with the singularity in apparent viscosity. The resulting system of partial differential equations is solved using the IAMR code (Incompressible Adaptive Mesh Refinement), which uses second-order Godunov methodology for the advective terms and semi-implicit diffusion in the context of an approximate projection method. By augmenting the IAMR code with the ability to simulate regularised Herschel-Bulkley fluids, we obtain efficient numerical software for viscoplastic flow which can be used to investigate systems previously considered too expensive computationally. We validate results from simulations using this new capability against previously published data for Bingham plastics and power-law fluids in the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. In doing so, we expand the range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers which have been considered in the benchmark tests.

abstract = {Here we present a new approach, called ADER, for constructing non-oscillatory advection schemes of arbitrary order of accuracy in space and time. The main ideas are presented in terms of the one-dimensional linear advection equation. As is well-known from Godunov's theorem [8], the two requirements of (i) high accuracy and (ii) absence of spurious oscillations near discontinuities are contradictory. Solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws are piece-wise smooth, which means that in general they contain smooth parts and discontinuities. Note also that smooth portions of the solution may contain large gradients which, numerically, may be as demanding as discontinuities. A classical way of circumventing Godunov's theorem is to construct non-linear schemes, even when applied to linear problems. A successful class of non-linear schemes are the so-called total Variation Diminishing Methods (or TVD methods) [9], [17] developed over the last two decades or so. Such schemes provide today the basis of a mature numerical technology suitable for industrial and scientific applications [14], [22], [23]. These methods are second-order accurate, almost everywhere, and reduce locally to first-order of accuracy. TVD methods however, are known to be unsuitable for special application areas such as acoustics, compressible turbulence and problems involving long-time evolution wave propagation. Extrema are clipped and numerical dissipation may become dominant The non-oscillatory methods we are attempting to construct here will be of much higher order of accuracy in both space and time and will not impose TVD-like constraints.},
